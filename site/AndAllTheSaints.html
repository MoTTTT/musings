<h1>PREFACE</h1>

<p>
In the Quarterly Paper of the Bloemfontein Mission of January 1903, Father Alfred Kelly SSM., wrote, "Up to a certain age man is acquisitive, and his real work is reading. When of an uncertain age, he turns generous, and his work is writing".
</p>
<p>
I suppose I must now have reached an uncertain-uncertain age, as this is really a compilation of other people's writing. It is based on extracts from letters, Parish Vestry and Council Minutes, newspaper articles, and other bits and pieces. 
</p>
<p>
This book grew out of some articles on the history of the Anglican Church in the Eastern Free State which I wrote for our parish Newsletter. As 1991 and the centenary of the All Saints' Church in Ficksburg approached, it was suggested that the articles be added to and printed as a pamphlet. This then grew, through the enthusiasm of a Church Warden, Mr. Mike van Gelder, into plans for a book to be published during the centenary year, and then to include the centenary year, so that publication follows the next year.
</p>
<p>
Although it was the All Saints' Church which was 100 years old, it was decided to include something about the other Anglican churches which now go to make up the Parish of All Saints', namely, St. George's, Clocolan; St. Mary's, Fouriesburg; and others which are no longer used or have long been broken down.
</p>
<p>
As an example, the first church in the Clocolan district was opened by the Bishop on the farm "The Grove" on January 20, 1889. So the pamphlet has developed into a book about All Saints' Parish to the year 1991.
</p>
<p>
Most of the information for the book has come from the Church Minute Books and, for the early years, from the Quarterly Papers of the Bloemfontein Diocese. When reference is made to letters, these are usually from the Quarterly Papers. Details of the sources are given at the end of the book.
</p>
<p>
My thanks go to all those who have made this buok not only possible but inicresting for me. All the "Oldtimers" whose reminiscences fascinated me even when they could not form part of the book, those who made photographs available, including Mrs. Nancy Gardiner who gave us the photographs of the church windows which she had used in a magazine article, and all the parishioners who gave encouragement by seeming to be interested in their Rector's efforts at producing a history. Not least, thank you to Wendy Treu and Anne van Gelder for checking the manuscript, and Michael van Gelder for the design and layout of the book.
</p>
<p>
With regard to history, though, the historians will no doubt find fault that the compiler / editor, call him what you will, has fallen into the old trap of giving the impression that the rest of the world did not exist when these events were taking place. I ask their forgiveness. Perhaps one of them will take all the books that have been written around Ficksburg in the same fashion and wnite a "complete history".
</p>
<p>
It remains only for me to say, "the faults are mine, the glory belongs to God and the people of All Saints' Parish, of the past and of the present, as we look to the future."
</p>
<h1>IN THE BEGINNING</h1>

<p>

What a marvellous history and tradition we Anglicans have. It is quite acceptable that the Anglican Church did not have its beginnings in Henry VIII, but long before that. Henry VII saw only the beginning of the establishment of the Church in England as the Church Established in English law, and through parliament with the reigning monarch.
</p>
<p>

Of course the Christian Church has its origins in Our Lord Jesus Christ, and that must always govern everything we do. The Gospel is our foundation, but the conduct of the local churches in the way they have organized the running of their daily lives has varied from place to place, beginning with St. Paul and the Jerusalem Church. The Anglican Church really goes back to St. Columba, and has its roots in the Celtic Church, St. Augustine, St. Benedict, and on through Whitby, St. Anselm, Julian of Norwich, to the Evangelical Revival and the Oxford Movement. All have played an important role in developing the form of conduct and worship which we know as "Anglican". Even today this is being influenced by changes taking place in our society and culture. The gospel remains the same, but the churches and their ethos must never become static or they will ossify or petrify.
</p>
<p>

As far as the beginnings of the Anglican Church in this part of the Eastern Free State, in the Republic of South Africa, is concerned, we need to look back to the Nineteenth Century.
</p>
<p>

Before about 1835 the country between the Orange and Vaal Rivers was hardly known to the 'white' settlers. Missionaries of the London Missionary Society entered the country about 1816, the Weslcyans about 1823. French missionaries passed through to Lesotho, or Basutoland as it was known for many years, in 1833. A fewof the farmers living in the north of the Cape Colony visited the area in times of drought, as did a few hunters, but it was not really until the Great Trek started in 1836 that any number of "Europeans" were to be found in the area we now know as the Orange Free State.
</p>
<p>

The arrival of the Anglican Church as such can be associated with the coming of the British soldiers to the Orange River Colony, and Dr. Robert Gray, the First Bishop of Cape Town, who paid a visit to"the Sovercignty" in 1850. He had no sooner arrived in Bloemfontein than he was entreated to place a resident clergyman there. So the Bishop and his host, Major Wardcn, went about choosing sites for a church, burial ground, parsonage, and school. On the Sunday the Bishop celebrated Holy Communion; married a couple, baptised, confirmed, consecrated the military burial-ground; conducted services for the troops in an open shed; and took another service with sermon in the school-house. So the work of the Anglican Church started in the Orange Free State. However, although Archdeacon Merriman visited the area twice and clergy were placed in Bloemfontein for short periods, it was not until the consecration of Bishop Twells in 1863 and the foundation of the new Diocese, that anything of real consequence was done.
</p>
<p>

The first Bishop of Bloemfontein, Bishop Edward Twells, arrived in the Diocese on 16 September 1863. By this time, besides Bloemfontcin, Winberg, Smithfield and Philippolis; Fauresmith and Harrismith, and the villages of Boshof and Jacobsdal, as well as Kroonstad and Bethlehem, had been founded.
</p>
<p>

We know from historical records that Ladybrand and Ficksburg came into existence only with the declaration of the 'Conquered Territories' at the end of the 3rd Basotho War. The "Gouvernments Courant" of 27 June 1867 asked for tenders for the measurement of 400 erwe in each of the three dorps of Ladybrand, Ficksburg, and Wepener.
</p>
<p>

Before this, however, in November 1864, a Mr. George Mitchell arrived with the special purpose of commencing a mission at Thaba 'Nchu. But here again we need to go back a bit in time for the events which led up to the choice of Thaba 'Nchu.
</p>
<p>

Moroka was the chief of the Seleka clan of the Borolong tribe, when drought drove them, accompanied by James Archbell, the Wesleyan missionary, from the southern bank of the Vaal nver to the area near a flat-topped hill known as Thaba 'Nchu, the Black Mountain. When Bishop Gray made his 1850 Visitation north of the Orange River, he visited Moroka at Thaba 'Nchu. Subsequently Moroka's son Samuel attended Bishop Gray's school in Cape Town, Zonnebloem, and then went on to St. Augustine's College, Canterbury. Chief Moroka had asked that Anglican missionaries be sent to Thaba 'Nchu, not because he was a Christian but because it was thought to be good politics in those troubled times. Bishop Twells duly sent Mr. Mitchell, who had been a fellow student of Samucl's at St. Augustine's College, and he and Samuel arrived together.
</p>
<p>

Bishop Twells had been dismayed at how much work lay before him in developing his new Diocese. In addition to this he found that clergy were unwilling to come out from England. At the beginning of 1866 he therefore decided to attempt a new form of mission work in the form of a missionary Brotherhood, the members of which should live by acommon rule, be content with food and clothing, and should be willing to work with their hands.
</p>

    <div class="figcaption">Bishop Twells First Supenor of Modderpoort</div>
</div>

<p>

So it was that the Reverend Canon Henry Frederick Beckett, a Canon of the Collegiate Church, Isle of Cumbrace, Scotland, answered the call to head the Brotherhood. Canon Beckett was an old friend of Bishop Twells and his family, and he at once proceeded to raise funds and gather acompany. Before leaving ona visit to England in 1867, Bishop Twells made arrangements for the purchase of two farms known as Modderpoort and Modderpoort Spruijt. The farms in the area had been granted to the burgers who had foughtin the Basuto Wars and the manto whom these had been granted, named Green, did not want to farm them and so they were bought for the sum of 352 pounds.
</p>
<p>

These two farms at Modderpoort were to be the centre for the work of the Missionary Brotherhood to be formed by the Bishop. The farms were purchased out of the funds raised by Canon Beckett for the establishment of the order, the Bishop being signatory on behalf of the order which had not yet been established.
</p>
<p>

Canon Beckett, together with Mr. William Crisp; Mr. J. E. Williams; a skilled mason, Mr. W. Terry; and two others, reached Port Elizabeth on July 12, 1867. Proceeding to Bloemfontein they found that war with the Basuto was in progress and it was therefore imprudent to go straight to the farms at Modderpoort. In point of fact it seems the commando which had been called up to clear the Conquered Territory of Basuto and avenge the murders which had taken place, actually had their base camp on the Modderpoort farms.
</p>
<p>

A farm named Springfield was hired for the use of the Brotherhood and the following May, Canon Beckett, now Canon of Bloemfontein Cathedral, moved with the Brethren to Thaba 'Nchu, where they built achurch which was dedicated by the Bishop on December 30 1868. Basutoland having been annexed by the British Governor, Woodhouse, at Moshocshoe's request, the brotherhood then moved on to occupy Modderpoort during Easter, 1869. As there was no accommodation for them at Modderpoort they set up "home" in acave on the side of the Plattcberg. Canon Beckett wrote in a letter in April 1869, "Aftcr unloading our wagon we turned our attcntion to the ordering of the cave, in which we have made our temporary home. By building up a wall of stones we have contrived to enlarge the arca so as to get aroom 12' x 14' for a Chapel, besides a small sleeping room, screencd off by a large stone. Both rooms we have much improved by digging away the floor so I can now stand upnghtin the Chapel, and sit upright in the bedroom." They lived in this cave for just over a year, until a house was built.
</p>
<p>

Services in Ladybrand commenced at a fairly early stage, while the first service was held in Wepener by the Rev. Bevan, a Priest Associate of the Brotherhood, on May 12, 1870. In March 1871, Canon Beckett left on along proposed visit to Ficksburg, Sand River, and Bethlehem, accompanied by Mr. Dixon.
</p>
<p>

In Ficksburg, which by this date was still smaller than Ladybrand, they were the guests of Mr. Mitchell "tat Imperani". On Saturday the Canon visited the people, finding that most of them spoke and understood English. Canon Beckett reported that six or more of the farmers were English. Four of them came in with their families on the Sunday, joining all the other inhabitants of the village at the service held by Canon Beckett.
</p>
<p>

On the Sunday afternoon a meeting was held and a subscription was made to build a school-chapel, the Canon promising to visit them again in two months.
</p>
<p>

On Saturday, June 3 1871, the Canon returned to Ficksburg, or Vicksburg as he spells it in his Ictter that refers to the visit. He describes the village as containing only ten houses at this visit. He was encouraged to find that the bricks and the windows for the new school-chapcl, which had been decided upon during his previous visit, were already in hand. The services on the Sunday were in Mr. Aran's house, and were attended each time by 31 adults and about 10 children, "while some remained outside
for wantofroom". There were several English speaking farmers in the neighbourhood whocame in for services, and there were four young women who were anxiously looking
forward to Confirmation. These young women, once they had been given some hope of an early Confirmation, took pains in preparing themselves. They were also "willing to go to Bloemfontein - three days' journey with horses, six days with oxen- when they were fully prepared". Two of them came eight miles for instruction at each of the Canon's visits.
</p>
<p>

In January 1872 the Diocese of Bloemfontein held the first Synod of the Diocese. At this assembly the future parochial organisation of the Diocese was discussed, and Canon Beckett advocated the establishment of aclergyman in the north east portion of the Diocese, whose ministrations would then include Ficksburg. However it would seem that this was not to happen for some years as there was still a great shortage of trained men in the Diocese, and even after someone was placcd in the area, Canon Beckett and his small group at Modderpoort continued to minister to the Ficksburg area from time to time.
</p>
<p>

In his Diary, Canon Beckett recorded in 1873 that they had begun to hold services at Ficksburg on the first Sunday in each month.
</p>
<p>

When we try to establish where the first Anglican Church in Ficksburg was sited in those early days we find that the Diocesan records report that Erf No's 1 and 3 were transferred to the Diocesan Trustees on the 8 March, 1873, and Erf No 13 was transferred to the Diocesan Trustees on the 27 October 1874. Erf No. 13 is on the corner of Van Andel and Fontein Streets, and the belief is that the little building which is still standing on this erf, in Van Andel Street, was the original "St. Columba's". We have to query whether this was in fact the first little school chapel referred to by Canon Beckett, built in 1871. In 1884, the Rev. T.O. Meyer refers to the church he had been appointed to in 1882 in the following terms; "I found a little church, so called, it being a former dwelling house, of two rooms. The partition wall was taken out, a dias formed of mud, with rough stone facings; and thus it became the church of St. Columba."
</p>
<p>

Now this does not seem to be the same chapel for which the congregation had obtained bricks and windows in 1871, so perhaps the school chapel was a previous building, separate from St. Columba's. Erf No's 1 and 3 were in Van Andel Street between Veldt and Brand streets, just opposite where the road across the railway line now goes to the station.
</p>
<p>

In September 1874 a theological student named Mr. G. M. Russell was sent as schoolmaster to Koppie Alleen, near Ficksburg. He gave services fortnightly at Ficksburg for about a year before moving to Katjiesberg near Brandwater.
</p>
<p>

By 1876, the Reverend Widdicombe reported that Ficksburg contained "about thirty houses, mostly built of un-burnt brick, two or three good-sized stores, a neatly-built Dutch Reformed Church, and an unpretending, but internally well-arranged English Church". He also reported that the Wesleyans held a service once in two months, and the Dutch Reformed Church about three times a year, but that he believed that the latter were making efforts to obtain a resident preacher of their own. His hostess on this particular visit was Mrs. Macdonald, while he made arrangements with another member of the Anglican Church, a mason named Bain Harris, for the erection of a Mission Chapel and School in Leribe.
</p>
<p>

Weshould perhaps side-track slightly withsome information about the mission at Thlotse Heights, Leribe, because Ficksburg was often served by clergy from the mission there. It was begun by the Reverend John Widdicombe in 1876 and he was helped by a Catechist and Schoolmaster, Mr. Lacy. In 1877 Mr. Widdicombe was joined by the Reverend F. Balfour, the church being opened by the Bishop in January of that year.
</p>
<p>

The mission station was called after the Thlotse, a little river running into the Caledon. These rivers formed a hazard when serviccs had to be held on the far side, especially after heavy rains. At one time one of the clergy from Thlotse had to serve Ficksburg once a fortnight. If the river was high, hchad toswim his horse over, and cross in a boat. In his book on the Diocese, William Crisp wrote that on the 9 December, 1877 "a grievous loss fell upon the young Mission of St. Saviour's, Thlotse Heights. Mr. W. Lacy... who had come into the Diocese while still a lad, and who had won the affection and regard of all who knew him, was drowned in the Caledon River." According to Canon Beckett's diary, he had accompanicd the Bishop's wife and children back to St. Augustine's, Modderpoort, and was returning to Thlotse when the accident occurred.
</p>
<p>

As the Reverend Balfour had moved to Sekubu, the Reverend Widdicombe was left on his own and so had to suspend his work in Ficksburg, Advance Poort and along the Caledon, but the Reverend Balfour arranged to visit Ficksburg from Sekubu, alternating with Canon Beckett.
</p>
<p>

In April 1880, Bishop Webb went to Ficksburg to meet with Father James Douglas, who had taken over as Superior of. Modderpoort from Canon Beckett. In the
record of the Bishop's visit in the "Quarterly Papers" we read, ".....now it is proposed to place a clergyman in charge of the district, towards whose support the people guarantee 150 pounds per annum. After the afternoon service on Sunday, a meeting was held, at which it was determined to buy a house, which had recently been built, for the sum of 350 pounds. A strong wish was expressed by some of the church people who lived at a distance from the village that a boarding school might be established, to which they might send their children, and that the clergyman who might come to them might be able to undertake this. The Bishop, however, decided that the work of the district was more than sufficient for the fullest energies of a clergyman, and advised them to wait till a year's experience of the wants of the place should enable him to encourage another helper to undertake the school......"
</p>
<p>

Erf No. 67, in Ficksburg was transferred to the Diocesan Trustees on May 23, 1881. This was the entire property in De Jager Street behind the present church and rectory grounds. The house referred to was on that erf, in Piet Retief Street, and was retained as a rectory for many years.
</p>
<p>

At the beginning of 1880 the Cape Colonial Government, which then had oversight over Basutoland, proclaimed their "Disarmament Policy" in which the Basuto were required to hand in their guns. Although some did so, there were those who resisted the policy and the "Gun Wars" broke out. As Thlotse was attacked at this time, the Reverend R.K. Champemowne took charge at Ficksburg, "most of our refugees being there".
</p>
<p>

In January 1877 a theological student, Mr. T.A Meyer. set out from England to join the Bloemfontein Diocese. He had had some Colonial experience and spoke Dutch fluently, "so that he is likely to be a valuable addition to the staff of the Diocese." This was to be the first resident clergyman in Ficksburg. After spending a number of years in training in Bloemfontein, including teaching at the school there, approval was given for his ordination, and it was decided to send him to Ficksburg.
</p>
<p>

Initially he was introduced to Ficksburg by the Reverend Father Douglas in July 1882, at which time the plan was that he should stay at Modderpoort and visit Ficksburg every fortnight, until after his ordination on September 24, 1882.
</p>
<p>

In the Diocesan News of the Bloemfontein Diocesan Magazine of March 1883, we read of the happenings in Ficksburg as follows;

<blockquote>The Bazaar in the beginning of January was a great success. All praise is due to the ladies, who, by their untiring labour, brought together from far and near both articles and purchasers. About 85 pounds were consequently paid of the debt of 148 pounds incurred in repairing the Parsonage. The ladies further presented Mr. Meyer with a purse of twenty sovereigns when he left for Bloemfontein to fetch home his bride. Mr. and Mrs. Meyer arrived in Ficksburg on the 27th of January, and were very warmly received by the parishioners. St. John's school opened on the 30th of January, and the school-room is now so crowded that a new building is an absolute necessity. There are 30 children on the roll, - 19 boys and 11 girls. Miss Stanley has kindly undertaken to assist in teaching during the afternoons.</blockquote>
</p>
<p>

The school was started in one of the rooms of the parsonage which the Reverend Mr. Meyer described in his letter of January 1884;

"...Now a few words regarding the school. We call the school St. John's School, and it is a great feature in the work.... began the school work in one of the rooms of the parsonage with 12 pupils. On last St. Andrew's Day (Nov. 30, 1883) we opened a new schoolroom with 27 pupils. This new school I built with private money, and it has
cost about 450 pounds....The school has a very large piece of ground for a playground attached to it. At present it is all private property, but I hope that the Church will be able to purchase it in years to come, at the cost of the outlay...."
</p>
<p>

In 1885 the Vicar General (there was no Bishop at the time), Father Davis G. Croghan, expressed the appreciation of the English farmers of the district who had families, for the advantages of the opportunity Mr. Mcyer's ability and experience in this line 'gave their children.
</p>
<p>

In a letter dated July 7, 1885, the Reverend Meyer tells of his journey to Bloemfontein during the school holidays, and the letter gives an interesting picture of life and-travel at that time. The Reverend Stenson from Wepener promised to take the services while he was away, so he set out with Mr. S. in his 'spider', "the distance to Bloemfontein being about 100 miles, over a good road". After stopping over that night at Ladybrand, in the clergyhousce closc to the church, and owncd by the St. Augustene's Brotherhood, they left about midday "and went slowly up the Platberg, from the top of which we had a lovely view of the Malutis...."
</p>
<p>

He continues in his letter, "Friday night we put up at a little wayside shop, where we were well taken care of. Saturday morning at seven o'clock we started again; it was bitterly cold, but the sun soon warmed us. About sunset we arrived at a wayside shop, where one generally finds a bed, a stable, and forage for the horses. These little innkeepers trade with the Boers and the Kafirs, and accommodate travellers. But alas ! the place was locked. Looking round, we found the door of a lite bedroom open, and the stable without a door. We had some food with us, and the only difficulty was to procure forage for our horses. I can speak Dutch, so I went to the neighbouring Dutch farmer and introduced myself as the English Predicant from Ficksburg. They invited us to supper, and provided for the horses.
</p>
<p>

There was a good piano, and we spent a very pleasant evening, talking Dutch. The conversation was chiefly with their schoolmaster, who informed us that he was engaged to prepare the grownup son and daughter for "Annehmen", Confirmation... The next day was Sunday, and we arrived at Bloemfontcin just in time for the eleven o'clock service at the Cathedral."
</p>
<p>

After the Reverend Meyer left Ficksburg (about the end of 1886) the school seems to have passed out of the hands of the Church, unt some time in 1890.
</p>


<h1>EARLY DAYS</h1>

<p>

As Father James Douglas of Modderpoort had been requested to send some of the members of the Society of Saint Augustine into Basutoland to open up the mission field there, the "Bishop in return promised to relieve the Church at Modderpoort of the district work in Ficksburg, Ladybrand and Clocolan. The plan was Carried out and in October 1889, the Reverend R. Gresley Douglas, a nephew of Father James Douglas, sailed from England to relieve Modderpoort of the Ficksburg and Ladybrand districts.
</p>
<p>

In aletter in the Quarterly Papers of April 1890 the Bishop wrote that the school in Ficksburg had been undertaken by aschoolmaster who had lately come from England and who had been licensed tohelp the Reverend Gresley Douglas by taking services in his absence. This was Mr. Harbord, who was ordained Deacon in December of the same year. The Bishop stated that this was a great gain for Ficksburg and that the school had been out of the church for some time. Deacon Harbord stayed in Ficksburg until the beginning of 1893, when he moved to Jagersfontein.
</p>
<p>

A meeting of the male parishioners of the Chapelry of Ficksburg was held on the Tuesday of Easter week April 8, 1890, inthe St. John's schoolroom, with the Rector of the Parish, Canon Douglas, in the chair. At this meeting the nced for a new church was discussed. Those present on this momentous occasion were, Canon Douglas, his nephew the Reverend Gresley Douglas, who was Priest-in-charge of the district, Dr. Taylor, Mr. William Mitchell, H. Foxcroft, J. Thom, Mr. Brumage senior, Walter Brumage, C. Brumage, R. Fichardt, G. Myers, W.R. Davics, F. Harbord, M. Harrics, P, Harries, a Mr. Cooper, and C. Spershott.
</p>
<p>

It was proposed that the present erf and the church on which it stood, be sold, and the proceeds divided, half going towards the erection of a church for the natives, and the other half towards the fund for the new English Church. At that stage it was proposed that both buildings be erected on the same erf. 
</p>
<p>

At the Diocesan Synod held in Bloemfontein that same month, it was resolved  that the chapelries then in existence should henceforth be placed under the charge of Vicars. These Vicars were tobe appointed by the Bishop with the consent of the Rectors of the Parish in which the chapelry was situated. The Vicars thus appointed were then to be in independent charge. As noted, Ficksburg had been achapelry in the Modderpoort Parish, with Canon James Douglas, the Superior of the Modderpoort Fathers, as Rector. Now the Reverend R. Gresley Douglas was duly licensed as the first Vicar of Ficksburg on June 25, 1890.
</p>
<p>

A service was first held in the new church on Whitsunday, May 17, 1891, when the Vicar cclebrated the Eucharist at 8 a.m., and preached at Mattins, while the Reverend Joseph Deacon, priest-in-charge of St. Saviour's, Thlotse Heights, preached at night.
</p>
<p>

At the annual Vestry meeting held on April 24, 1892, it was decided that the new church required a porch and further fund raising was put in hand. 
</p>
<p>

The church was dedicated to All Saints' on January 21 1893 by the Bishop, the church register recording the fact that, "Rain came on just before the service - but a hearty service'. The following day, a Sunday, the Bishop confirmed 17 from Ficksburg and two from Modderpoort.
</p>
<p>

A comment in the Service register on August 20, 1893, at the 8 a.m. Service was, "Two ladies present, one fainted. No collection." One wonders whether it was the event of the lady fainting which caused the omission of collection, or whether there were ONLY two ladies present, and with one unconscious, it was felt unfair to wave the collection bag at the one remaining faithful parishioner.
</p>
<p>

The Reverend R. Gresley Douglas left Ficksburg in November 1893, to take charge of the parish of Beaconsfield. He was succeeded as Vicar of Ficksburg by the Reverend F. M. Lane, who had been working as Assistant-Curate at Modderpoort from October the previous year.
</p>
<p>

In 1894 an effort was made to systematise the work amongst the coloured people and provide them witha church in which to worship. The ladics of the European congregation worked diligently with a view to raise the necessary means. Already in hand, or promised, was a considerable sum of money, several "ornaments" for the Church, and the land on which to build it. This was a large erf on the corner of Visser and Einde streets, in what became Caledon Park.
</p>
<p>

Also in 1894 Canon James Douglas of Modderpoort, having been ill for some time, died at the age of 52. The whole Diocese mourncd the passing of this much-loved priest, services being held around the country, including as far away as Port Elizabeth, and 'The Standard and Digger's News' of Johannesburg recorded on the 20 August the special services at St. Mary's in some detail.

The "Church Magazine" was a magazine for the Diocese of Bloemfontein to which the various parishes contributed articles concerning their activities. An interesting anecdote is recorded in the "Church Magazine" of May 15, 1895, as follows:

<blockquote>
    Easter Sunday morning afforded a unique and most gratifying instance, first, of ill-applied, then of well-applied, energy. The Easter decorations had been made more elaborate, and, if possible, prettier than usual. When all the work, which had been done outside, was finished and put into the Church, instructions were given, in the purest Sesuto, to a servant to sweep up the litter outside the church. On Sunday morning, before the Early celebration, every trace of decoration had disappeared, the chairs were in confusion, and what had been, on Saturday evening, a beautifully arranged floral Easter offering, was now a heap of rubbish outside the door. The first thought was naturally "An enemy ? What fearful sacrilege !" Happily an explanation was forthcoming to give the horrified worshippers at the early service. The servant had misunderstood his instructions, and had, most energetically, before 7 a.m., cleared every vestige of decoration from the Church. The best remains to be told. Before 9 a.m. fresh flowers had been sent in from all parts of the town, a zealous band of workers had collected together, and at 11 o'clock the decorations were prettier, because fresher, than ever, thanks to the plucky determination of the faithful band.
</blockquote>

</p>
<p>The new altar rails, designed, made and erected by one of the communicants, were up in time for the Confirmation service on the 26 May, 1895.</p>

<p>On July 28, 1895 the Church Services register recorded that the parishioners had gone to the Dutch "Naachtmaal" for the institution of their new minister. This was Ds. P.J.J. Boshoff who had come from Ventersburg. It also recorded that there was much sickness in town, chiefly influenza and whooping cough.</p>

<p>A Sunday School treat was organised in January of 1896 and was reported in the Church Magazine as follows:


<blockquote>
    ....In which event particular mention should be made of our Churchwarden, Mr. Foxcroft, and Mr. Wilkins, under whose auspiccs we found ourselves travelling in wagons belonging to Mr. Foxcroft and Mr. C. Harris, drawn by teams of bullocks lent by Mr. Harris and Mr. William Spershott......and conducted by Mr. Graham Mac Askill to a charming spot in the Poort beyond the bridge, and we found ourselves at an early hour ensconced under a wide stretch of canvas, on a bright grassy slope, on a hot day, in a breezy spot amongst rocks and mountains, enlivened by the silvery streak of a bend in the smiling Mogokare River.
</blockquote>

The Mogokare is, of course, what we know as the Caledon River. 

</p>
<p>

In January 1898 a cloudy day caused some foreboding for the Sunday School treat on the 5th, but it seemed "to have rained heavily almost every where around except at the beautiful spot, perfect for a picnic, where, by the kind permission of Mr. and Miss Bowie, we encamped, and where the scholars and their friends congregated in considerable numbers.
</p>
<p>

Mrs. H.S. Taylor, in the unavoidable absence of Dr. Taylor, very graciously consented to distribute the prizes; and the superabundance of good things was provided by the friends of our valued and indefatigable teacher, Miss Cooke.
</p>
<p>

The sports were conducted by Dr. J. Browncon amore, the rule for prizes being that no single child could receive more than one....."
</p>
<p>

'January 6th (1898), saw the meeting of a large and somewhat lazy Diocesan work party, which, after Evensong for the Feast of Epiphany, adjourned for cake and tea to "Toy House," where the Vicar had the great pleasure of distributing some handsome books provided by Miss C.M. Cooke for those scholars of her flounshing day school who did best in the voluntary work which was advised them for their holidays."
</p>
<p>

There is no record of when the Harmonium was obtained, but in October 1898 it was recorded that, "the carved organ stool of dark hardwood, presented by Misses Cooke, Elliotte, Sanders, and Mrs. Carter, now in use, is a most pleasing addition to the choir furniture, and is in exact keeping with the framework of the organ. The accounts for 1893 itemises an amount of 10 shillings for "Carriage of old organ to Winburg", which seems to indicate that unless the Church has had other organs over the years, the Harmonium known to us in 1991 was obtained in about 1892.
</p>
<p>

The story of the Boer War and its influence on Ficksburg has been told by a number of writers from different viewpoints, among them Dr. Henry Taylor, at one time the Chapelry treasurer, and Anna Barry in her book "Ons Japie". A Commando from Ficksburg under kommandant Jan van Schalkwyk were part of the Boer force which routed the British at Magersfontein in December 1899, and various books on the Boer War refer to Ficksburg and its relevance to Boer and British manouvers.
</p>
<p>

The War also made its impact on the church in Ficksburg, and various notations in the Services Register tell of the coming and going of the combatants and other incidents. In a letter to the Quarterly Papers dated June 28, 1900, the Reverend Deacon at Tsikoane, Leribe, wrote, "There is a strong body of troops in Ficksburg and in the neighbourhood now; they have been there for a month past. We don't know what they are doing; for they are, very wisely, not telling the world much about their plans. Provisions are very scarce in that place; ordinary paraffin candlcs being 5d. each - that is, the six to the lb. size! There is hardly any tea to be had, coffee is very dear, and soap almost unobtainable. Transport charges are very high, and it is difficult to secure wagons."
</p>
<p>

This 'body of troops' referred to by the Reverend Deacon, were part of the build-up of 16000 British troops in this area of the Free State as President Steyn and Christiaan de Wet fell back to Bethlehem. Shortly after this came the concentration of the forces around and in the Brandwater basin, that area stretching from Commando Nek outside Ficksburg, through Fouriesberg and up to Slabberts. As the Boers were trapped by the British, 4500 were forced to surrender in the mountains leading to the Golden Gate area.
</p>
<p>

During the war The Vicar of Ficksburg, the Reverend Olive, found the isolation rather trying, but on the whole was left alone. However, at one point he wrote that he had been threatened as he was accused of singing "God Save the Queen", and "Rule Britannia" in church. Finally, at the beginning of 1901 he was forced to leave Ficksburg during an occupation of the town by the Boers, and took refuge at Tsikoane in Lesotho. There was areport that on January 4, 1901 the Boers had arrested the Vicar and removed articles from the Church.
</p>
<p>

By February 1901, the boers who were still fighting had joined de Wet as he headed south, and the British once more returned to Ficksburg. The Church was used as a military hospital, so services were held in the Town Hall by Army Chaplains until the Church was handed back by the military and opened for Divine Service again on July 20, 1902. The Army Chaplains during this period were the Reverends Findley, White, Rayner and Stewart.
</p>
<p>

It is interesting to note from the Army Book of Services that during the occupation, apart from the services held in the Town Hall and hospital wards, services were held on the Imperani, on Stafford Hill, and also on "Worcester Hill".
</p>
<p>

During much of the war the clergy in the various towns were cut off from Bloemfontein and the rest of the Diocese and so, although there was no Bishop in the Diocese, it was not possible to call a meeting of Synod to elect a Bishop. 
</p>
<p>

In September 1902 the regiment (1st Worcester) was withdrawn, and the Reverend L.W. Olive having previously resigned, the parish was left without a Vicar. The Reverend Fogarty, Principal of St. Mary's, Thlotse Heights, undertook to provide services every Sunday until a new Vicar could take up the work. Finally towards the end of the year the Reverend G.E.A. Hilliard took charge in Ficksburg.
</p>
<p>

At the Vestry meeting in 1905, the plans for the erection of the church bell were finalised. Also, it was agreed to buy a new iron gate for crection opposite the Church porch. In 1907 agreement was reached to have seats made to replace the chairs.
</p>
<p>

In 1907, Bishop Arthur wrote in a letter that he had undertaken a trip to the North of Basutoland, going from Modderpoort to Ficksburg on the new railway line, which was notyet opened. He wrote, "I started in the guard's van of aconstruction train, then changed onto arailway trolley, and finally boarded another construction train, and entered Ficksburg in great glory, seated on my portmanteau on top of a truck full of ballast." One wonders if he was wearing his gaiters and full regalia as he steamed  into Ficksburg!
</p>
<p>

In 1907 the Reverend Tatham came to Ficksburg, but had to give up the work here after only afew months, on account of his and Mrs. Tatham's health, and so moved to work with the Reverend Gresicy Douglas who was by now working in Rondebosch. 
</p>
<p>

He was succeeded by the Reverend C.S. Hill who could only come in 1908, so Father Haynes from Sekubu took services in Ficksburg on a regular basis until Father Hill arrived.
</p>
<p>

Another farm on which services were held was "Hillside'" at ""Roodekrantz" where Mr. and Mrs. S. Peacock kindly lent their house for the service, "and most hospitably entertained at luncheon those whocame from a distance." Services here were held once a quarter.
</p>
<p>

An interesting commendation was made at the 1909 Vestry when Mr. Snell was thanked "for his services in lighting the Church and ringing the bell', an insight into the days before electricity, when 'putting on the light' could be quite a chore.
</p>
<p>

In 1909 the children's picnic was held at Morgenzon "on the King's Birthday", an event which seemed to be enjoycd by all. Mr. Bowie and Misses Annandale provided the hospitality and Messrs. J. Wilkins, W. Mitchell and Rorke Icnt wagons. Prizes for sports were handed out as well as Catechism prizes.
</p>
<p>

In 1910 a scarlet fever epidemic affected the Sunday Catcchism classes for a few Sundays, but by Advent Sunday a new beginning was made. In 1911 it was an epidemic of measles which affected Sunday School and congregations in gencral. We have got so unused to what was once a common occurrence in the health of a town at one time that we should perhaps be reminded from time to time and give thanks to God for modem medicine and the medical profession.
</p>
<p>

Canon H.W. Orford came to Ficksburg next, this in 1911, and as he took charge of a considerable amount of country work in the castem part of the Free State, the Reverend E.H. Hemsted came to join him. As Archdeacon, later Assistant Bishop, Balfour was a long-standing friend of Canon and Mrs. Orford's, he took up residence with them in Ficksburg, making this his headquarters for a while, although most of his time was spent in Basutoland. The Reverend Hemsted stayed until 1915, at which time he went to Kroonstad and the Reverend H.J. Beddy, a deacon, took his place.
</p>
<p>

Canon Orford's second son, Mr. J.F.W. Orford, was reading for his ordination and in 1912 was admitted as a sub-deacon by Bishop Balfour at the Harvest Festival service in February. Mr. Orford was able to help in the parish in many ways until he left for St. Paul's Hostel in Grahamstown to further his theological studies.
</p>
<p>

It is interesting to note that it was only in 1914, that Synod passed a Canon entitling women communicants of the parish to take part and vote in the Vestry meeting. Prior to this only male communicants could do this.
</p>


<h1>THE LADIES OF ALL SAINTS'</h1>

<p>

Early in 1894 a Branch of the Bloemfontein Mission Association was established in Ficksburg with an initial roll of sixteen members. A Working Guild in connection with the Association was organised to raise funds for the extension of Church work. This is the first that we hear of an organised group of ladies getting together for church work, although individuals had been hard at it from the St. Columba's days.
</p>
<p>

The Church Magazine of February 15, 1894, recorded that two magnificent pieces of embroidery (a violet veil and violet burse in silk, worked in gold and coloured silks) had been presented to the church, mainly the delicate workmanship and exquisite skill of Miss Cooke. This was soon followed by two violet alms-bags, of richest silk velvet, each embroidered with a cross worked in bas-relief with white silks, set off with four ruby taches and entwined with the Crown of Thorns. 
</p>
<p>

Later on we learn that on Easter Sunday they used the new white Altar wings, embroidered with appliques of stamped plush bordered with white silk. Also there were white watered silk veil, burse, and alms bags, all of them embroidered with silks and gold, and edged with gilt cable braid. 
</p>
<p>

The Working Guild met, as a general rule, on the Saturday before the first Sunday of every month, gathering for sewing and other work in the School-room from 4to6, during which a paper or article was read by one of the members. This was followed by Evensong, Special Mission Service, and short Address in the church. Saturday was chosen as the most convenient day for country members, that they might come in on Saturday afternoon and remain for the Sunday Service. More especially this had the purpose of uniting together all the members of the Association by enabling them tomake their communion together, at the early celebration on the first Sunday of the month. At this time the President of the Guild was Mrs. C. Brumage. 
</p>
<p>

When the addition of a Porch and Vestry was mooted, the Working Guild immediately set to work to organise a bazaar, inviting the whole congregation to take part in it. This bazaar took placc in the weck after Easter Sunday 1895, when 240 pounds was raised, this when a pound was worth a pound. Amongst the items produccd for the stalls were some beautifully etched tea-cloths, an embroidered dress skirt, a Yorkshire landscape in oils, a most handsome bridal doll and some 'sumptuous cushions'.The ladies presiding over the event were Mrs. Brumage and Mrs. Newberry. 
</p>
<p>

The ladies continued their work in the parish and in 1909 the Vestry asked for a ladies' committee to be formed to collect the subscriptions of the church members. Mrs. Brumage and Mrs. Harvey were asked to undertake this task. This work was then continued by Mrs. D. Macaskill until 1914, when Miss Rowe took over. Different ladies then continued this task for some years.
</p>
<p>

The ladies were also involved in the cleaning and keeping of the church and its contents in order. In this regard Miss Phillimore is mentioned in 1912, and Miss Queenie Snell assisted by Olive Trollip in 1913.
</p>
<p>

On April 23, 1910, Miss Whitley, whohad come from England tospend 2 years in S. Africa in order to make known the objects and work of the "Mothers' Union" and the "Girls Friendly Society", paid a visit to Ficksburg. A large gathering of ladies assembled in the church grounds to meet her, and she gave a most excellent address. "Miss Whitley also went to Miss Phillimore's reading class for girls with which she was highly delighted." Unfortunately for the town, Miss Phillimore was to leave Ficksburg for Grahamstown in 1912.
</p>
<p>

At the conclusion of Miss Whitley's meeting, the ladies remained to arrange for a working party to be formed for raising money for the Church. Mrs. Leysath, Mrs. Snell, Mrs. Arnott, Mrs. von Berg, Mrs. Truby, Mrs. Seibert, Mrs. Roth, Mrs. Donaldson and Mrs. Macaskill were elected to be an executive committee. The work party was to meet in the Church Cottage on Saturday afternoons.
</p>
<p>

The ladies were to meet regularly on Thursday's at3 p.m. in the Church Cottage and it was proposed to hold a bazaar near the end of the year. In order to provide the ladies with material for their work, a café chantant was held in the Town Hall.
</p>
<p>

In 1912 the Ladies Working Party held a very successful bazaar which was opened by the wife of the resident magistrate, Mrs. van Iddekinge. The bazaar brought in a total of over 129 pounds.
</p>
<p>

Mention has already been made of the decision at the 1914 Synod to allow ladies to take part and vote at Parish Vestry meetings. The first ladics who used their rights did so at the Vestry meeting held on Easter Day April 14, 1915, and the names mentioned in the Vestry Minutes were; Mrs. Amott, Mrs. Snell, and Miss Rowe.
</p>
<p>

With many of the men-folk away during the 1914-1918 war it was difficult to keep the parish running smoothly, but 'the few' kept the church going.
</p>
<p>

In 1921 a special meeting of the whole parish confirmed that the yearly Diocesan Assessment should be raised by direct subscription from the members of the congregation and not from the monies raised from bazaars. This principle comes to the fore again and again in various parishes and should be noted. Funds raised by bazaars and other activities by the Ladies' Guilds should be used for special projects and the general benefit of the church in the parish, apart from a tithe from these funds which may be given to various charities.
</p>
<p>

In the mean time the ladies had continued to be responsible for the collecting of monthly subscriptions, and around 1929 we find the name of Miss Train being mentioned in this regard.
</p>
<p>

Mrs. Harcourt Vernon either continued the Working Guild or Work party, or started a new one. She was instrumental in getting the children organised as a work group again, and this did invaluable work. The Children's Working Party had been active in 1910 when they were recorded as working for the Bloemfontein Orphanage.
</p>
<p>

In 1929 it was decided to establish a Women's Guild and a meeting was convened by Mrs. Harcourt Vernon at Mrs. Leysath's house to put this into effect. Meetings were initially held in the private homes of members, and then later on in the "Summer House" which was in the church grounds. Mrs. Gwen Wille, one of the founding members of the Guild, has written a brief history of the Guild based on the minutes. This was written up in 1979 tocommemorate the 50th anniversary of the Guild, and then brought up-to-date by Mrs. Wille in 1990 and published as a booklet in 1991 as part of the All Saints' Centenary activities. Initially the Work Party activities were continued side by side with those of the Guild, and at the 1932 Vestry Meeting separate accounts were submitted.
</p>
<p>

The 1930's were very difficult times for the parish and the Women's Guild played an invaluable part in helping toraise funds for the continued running of the parish. The Guild held bazaars and jumble sales which, although not raising as much money as those mentioned previously, were very good considering the poor economic climate of the 1930's. An interesting inclusion in their fund-raising at the bazaars were the teas, as, not only was tea served at the bazaar itself, but tea was taken round the town, the "waitresses" being girls from the Girl Guides organisation.
</p>
<p>

Certainly one of the highlights of these activities must have been the fete held in the garden of "The Gables", Dr. Arnott's house. The usual Cake and Candy stall's, White Elephant stall, and Dips were organised, as well as competitions such as clock-golf, penny-on-the-square, shooting gallery and coconut shy. In addition there were sports, such as the favourite sack race, obstacle and potato races, and a "ladies-horse-race". To round things off there was also a Pierrot troupe.
</p>
<p>

The spiritual side was not forgotten at the Guild meetings, as the Guild asked Canon Vernon to conduct a short service after each meeting, and this was continued by the Reverend Findley after he became Rector. It was also customary to hold a corporate communion service, before the Guild meeting, every quarter. This spiritual side of what is actually a church association, seems to have become a bit neglected later on, with certain members feeling that the Guild should be purely a social and service club. This caused the Reverend Mr. Wheat to suggest that the spirit of the Guild was emphasising the Martha rather than the Mary side of their natures, and proposed a church service in connection with their meetings. This was started but unfortunately the Guild felt that Mr. Wheat's services were rather long, so they decided to have a special Guild communion once a month.
</p>

<p>

It is most unfortunate that the All Saints' Guild records for the first four years were lost, as it is now difficult to record, accurately, their beginnings. The first set of minutes which we still have is that for the 41st meeting held in Mrs. L. Sorour's house on Friday, December 8, 1933. Working backwards, and excluding January and July (although in 1933 and 1932 a July meeting WAS held), one arrives at the first meeting being held in December 1929. Mrs. Gwen Wille remembers the inaugural meeting being held late in 1929, and certainly the All Saints' financial report for 1930 records a sum of 37 pounds received from the "Ladies Guild". However, the 45th Meeting, held on May 11, 1934, is recorded as the fourth anniversary meeting, and the guild continued to celebrate their anniversary in May each year. Also, if one takes into consideration that meetings were held in July, working back results in the first meeting being held in May 1930. It is possible, therefore, that the gathering at Mrs. Leysath's house was to discuss the formation of a Guild but that the first official meeting of the Guild was in May 1930.
</p>
<p>

Another activity organised by the Guild in those early years was an annual Christmas party for the children belonging to the church. In 1936 this was held in the Town Hall and presents were given to all the children. They were entertained by Mr. Billie Orrock and Miss Joan Anderson with Mrs. Short helping with the music. Naturally goodies such as ice cream were also part of the day.
</p>
<p>

The end of 1936 also saw the death of Canon Harcourt Vernon, which meant that Mrs. Vernon, the Life President, was absent for some time. Her Girls' Work Party was continued, however, by Mrs. Lloyd, Mrs. Louw, and Mrs. Leysath, although on a more modest scale.
</p>
<p>

Other activities of the Guild of a more social nature included entertaining the Methodist ladies and the Presbyterian ladies to tea, and the new Rector was received with a public welcome party organised by the Guild.
</p>
<p>

Charitable activities included assisting a lady, who suffered from tuberculosis, with a financial supplementation, and making an allowance to a widow and her children.
</p>
<p>

An interesting point which arises from the old minutes is that members were recorded under their husband's initials or names. That is, reference would be made to Mrs. Carl Wille, for instance, or Mrs. Jack Tennent. How our customs have changed, not only had there been a change to using the lady's name, but formality has dropped away as well, so that minutes might refer just to June Berend or Cedar Sorour. In fact, some secretarics have queried whether it was necessary even to mention the surname, "as everyone knows who is meant". Certainly this editor believes we should continue the use of sumames as well, as in 50 or even 100 year's time it might be difficult for someone reading the minutes to know who was meant.
</p>
<p>

So, over the years, produce sales followed annual bazaars, to be followed by fete's and cake sales. All to the benefit of the All Saints' Church and selected charities. In addition there were always some members who found delight in using their God-given talents to sew and do similar work on Altar cloths and other church linen.
</p>
<p>

At the 218th Meeting on May 11, 1951, the Rector, the Reverend Wheat, was requested to compile a prayer especially for the Guild. This he duly did and the prayer was used for the first time at the 219th Meeting on 8 June 1951.
</p>
<p>

Each year, at the May meeting, the anniversary was remembered until 1946, when the minutes of the 169th meeting held on 10th May referred to the meeting as being both the Annual General Meeting and also the anniversary of the Guild. By 1947 the Annual General Meeting made no reference to an anniversary. In 1950 someone remembered that May was the anniversary of the Guild, but thereafter no mention is made of it until 1955, when the 25th birthday party was held at the meeting of 13th May, and Mrs. Lloyd, a founder member, recalled the founding of the Guild.
</p>
<p>

In 1968 it was decided to bring the financial year into line with that of the Parish Council, which now ended their year in December. The Annual General Meeting was therefore held in December 1968 and the Guild seemed to move further away from remembering the Guild Anniversary date.
</p>
<p>

However the minutes record that a 40th Birthday party was held on May 8, 1970, and Mrs. Wille gave a talk on the history of the Guild.
</p>
<p>

The Guild continued to meet regularly and to work for the church and in 1985 a bazaar was planned in which the ladies from Clocolan, Marquard and Fouriesburg were to contribute and assist. Unfortunately this co-operation did not come off and the proceeds were divided between All Saints' Guild and St. George's Guild.
</p>
<p>

The ladies also started working on new kneelers for the church during 1985 and a progressive supper was planned and carried out in November. As the Mission team from St. Paul's College came to the parish the ladies were very involved in the catering for the various functions.
</p>
<p>

Renovations to the Church Hall were carried out and financed by the Guild in 1986 and new plastic chairs were purchased in place of the old wooden ones which were Starting to collapse when the ladies least expected it - one unfortunate lady was dumped on the floor during a serious discussion, but fortunately no one was seriously hurt.
</p>
<p>

Mrs. Gwen Wille had been a foundation member of the Guild and so in 1987 she was made a life member and presented with an illuminated address.
</p>
<p>

For a number of years an attempt had been made to accumulate recipes to be published in book form and this was finalised in 1987 with the publication of a booklet titled "Saintly Foods".
</p>
<p>

Flowers have always been dear to the heart of members of the Guild and many are members of the local Horticultural Society, so when the Bloemfontein Cathedral held a Spring Carnival in which one of the items was a "Home and Garden" flower display in the Cathedral, the ladies were pleased to accept an invitation to take part. Their theme was a text from the Bible and Ficksburg took the honours with Mrs. Alice Tennent taking first prize and Mrs. Annette Barrett the third prize. The second prize was won by a lady who had previously lived in Ficksburg.
</p>
<p>

A very successful luncheon was organised by the Guild after the Patronal Festival Service on the 30 October 1988, when the meal was served in the Church Gardens. The Venerable John Davis from Bloemfontein was the celebrant and preacher at the Service.
</p>
<p>

Various guest speakers addressed the Guild from time to time and in 1988 these included the Ficksburg Social Worker - Mrs. Suzette du Plooy, and in 1989 Mrs. Jane McPherson from Tweespruit spoke about Kupagani, while Miss Cate Ogilvey, the Rotary exchange student from Australia gave an enlightening talk on her experiences as an exchange student.
</p>
<p>

The All Saints' Ladies Guild were very involved with the move to start a Senior Citizens Service Centre in Ficksburg in 1990, and members of the Guild played a vital role in the initial stages although the Afrikaans church community eventually took control of the organisation.
</p>
<p>

The old Harmonium had been showing its age in a number of ways and it was generally felt that a new organ was required, and with the foundation of a good donation from a parish family as a base, the ladies started working towards assisting the organ fund. Their efforts, plus further donations from parishioners, enabled the parish to purchase the new Alan Organ in 1991.
</p>
<p>

The parish luncheon in the church grounds had been so successful in 1988 that it was decided to include a similar luncheon at the start of the year long centenary celebrations on the day of the Patronal Festival, November 4, 1990. The preacher at the service was the Dean of Bloemfontein, Father Paddy Glover, and he and his wife were guests at the most enjoyable luncheon organised by the ladies.
</p>


<h1>CLOCOLAN DISTRICT</h1>

<p>

On one of his first visits to the North of Modderpoort, Canon Beckett, the Superior of Modderpoort, returned via Clocolan, staying the night at Mr. Warden's. This was on Monday 27 March, 1871.
</p>
<p>

Previous to this there had been various Methodist Missions in the area, according to papers written by Mrs. June Boddam-Whetham. She cites the Lishuane Wesleyan Mission between the present towns of Ladybrand and Clocolan, on the site of the present farm Groenkloof, but very little is known of this mission and all signs of it have completely disappeared. Another was the Umpukane Mission, about five miles west of Clocolan, founded about 1834 but destroyed about 1850, and all records were destroyed with it.
</p>
<p>

A Mission was established at Mequatling in 1837 by M.Francois Daumas of the Société des Missions Evangéliques, and much has been written about it in books by Arbousset, Casalis, Ellenberger, and others. Bishop Gray was the guest of the French Missionary there in 1850, when he went to see the chief Molitzani.
</p>
<p>

It would seem that once the S.S.A. Fathers were established at Modderpoort they started making regular visits to Ficksburg and other places in that area, and Clocolan and district was certainly one of the places where services were held.
</p>
<p>

Early references to services at Clocolan refer to both Mr. Vincent's store and the Rudman's farm, and it would seem that they were far enough apart for services to be held at both places. Mr. Vincent's store was in the region of Clocolanberg, some five to eight kilometres north of the present town of Clocolan.
</p>
<p>

The Rudman's were originally 1820 Settlers, Benjamin Rudman and Samual Rudman with his wife Ann arriving in South Africa with Scphton's party in the ship 'Aurora'.
</p>
<p>

Services were heldon Mr. Rudman's farm from about 1878, at first about every two months, then Father James Douglas increased this to a service every month. By 1887 the Modderpoort Brotherhood were holding a service there every second and fourth Sunday in the month, with an early celebration on the fourth Sunday.
</p>
<p>

In November, 1887, Bishop Knight-Bruce passed through on a Visitation to his Diocese, and found that a meeting had been timed to take place while he was there. This meeting arose from the feeling that a building should be put up for the services, because, as Mr. Vincent wrote in a letter published in the "Bloemfontein Quarterly of April 16, 1888; "..the congregation has increased, so that the room so kindly placed at our disposal for so many years by the Rudman's is too small, and as there is every prospect of the congregation increasing, owing to the recent gold discoveries..."
</p>
<p>

At the meeting which followed a church service, it was decided to build a place on Rudman's farm, which could be used as a school in the week and for services on Sunday's. A building committee, consisting of Messrs. J.andS. Rudman, A. Bisset, and Mr. Vincent, was appointed to carry out the work.
</p>
<p>

Just how remote from civilisation people had been living in South Africa is highlighted by the comments by one old Englishman at the above service, to the effect that he had not seen a Bishop since 1832, which was about 20 years before Bishop Knight-Bruce was born. One can understand how appreciative the people were to have a Bishop in their midst and to know that their Church cared for their spiritual well-being enough to send priests, and even a Bishop, into the wilds of Africa.
</p>
<p>

In a letter written in January, 1889, by Mr. Vincent, we leam that the original plan had to be modified for want of funds. Mr. James Rudman rented them a house for 18 pounds per annum on the farm "The Grove"; the house being situated between the present farm houses of Lovedale and Rosebank.
</p>
<p>

The "Grove Church" was opened by the Bishop on Sunday 20 January, 1889. During the opening services the "Venite",'"T'e Deum" , and "Benedictus" were chanted. The hymns were "Onward! Christian Soldiers," to the St. Alban's tune; ""The Church's One Foundation"; "We love the place O God"; "Let's sing with Holy gladness"; and during the Communion, "Draw nigh and take."
</p>
<p>

Of a visit to Clocolan in 1890, the Bishop wrote, "I came for Sunday to the new church near Clocolan. Here there was not a large Confirmation, but it was a very interesting one. So large anumber of people came from the farms around and some must have come considerable distances that I do not think the little church was large enough for them."
</p>
<p>

The Grove Church is remembered by quite anumber of Rudmans as their first school, classes being held there during the week.
</p>
<p>

During 1889, the Bishop had requested Father James Douglas to send some of the members of the Society of St. Augustine into Britsh Basutoland to open up a Mission station, and in return promised to relieve the mother church at Modderpoort of the district work in Ficksburg, Ladybrand and Clocolan. As a result the Rev. R. Gresley Douglas, anephew of Father James Douglas, sailed from England in October, 1889 to undertake the district work, taking up residence at Ficksburg, as has already been noted. When he left Ficksburg to go as Rector to Beaconsfield in 1893, the Brothers of Modderpoort took over the Clocolan responsibilities again.
</p>
<p>

It was at the Diocesan Synod of 1893 that the formation of the Chapelry of Clocolan was confirmed by a resolution of the Synod. The lay representatives at this Synod were Mr. H.W. Stockdale and Mr. C. Vincent.
</p>
<p>

In January 1894 the Bishop confirmed seven persons at Clocolan and in the Church Magazine for that same month weread that services were being held at Clocolan and "Tandzsberg'. At the 'Grove' Church there was a Celebration of Holy Communion on alternate Sundays at 7.30, and Mattins at 11. In the afternoon a service was held for boys belonging to the English Church who were at St. Leo's College, Evening Star, and this service was held in Mr. Coleman's house, by his kind permission. In the Evening, at 8 p.m. there was Evensong at Mr. Vincent's store at Clocolan, and on the following
morning (Monday) there was a celebration of Holy Communion.
</p>
<p>

At the beginning of 1894 the Reverend Vernon was also helping with services at Clocolan, and by the November of the same year he had agreed to take the twice monthly services at the Grove on a regular basis. Those at Mr. Vincent's store and at Mr. Coleman's were still being supplied from Modderpoort.
</p>
<p>

The Early Celebrations at the Grove Church on Christmas morning in 1894 had the largest number of Communicants that had ever been noted in that little Church, and at the Midday Service the building was again full to overflowing. The number of communicants recorded on Christmas Day at the Grove was 33. It should be realised that at that time a large number of churchgoers were not confirmed, or not actually members of the Anglican Church, but still attended the services. Mrs. Vernon had thoughtfully prepared a picnic breakfast under the trees in Mrs. Rudman's garden for all those who had come from a distance. This enabled many who would otherwise have been unable to come to the early service, to do so.
</p>
<p>

On the feast of the Epiphany (January 6, 1895) the usual Quarterly Celebration for the Omega District was held at Tandjicsberg, in the house of Mr. John Dodd. Other than this there was a service at Tandjicsberg on the second Sunday of each month at 3 p.m. Services at the Clocolan Store were held on January 20th, 21st, and 22nd. The last was for a few Basuto Communicants in the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>

On Christmas Day 1898, the Chapel of St. Michael and All Angels was Dedicated on the farm "Keble", owned by the Reverend A.H. Harcourt Vernon. The Prayer of Dedication immediately preceded the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist, the service being conducted by the Reverend Harcourt Vernon.
</p>
<p>

At "Prynnesberg", also in the Clocolan District, although on the Ficksburg side of the town, Mr. Charles Newberry also set out to build a church on his farm. However it was not until 1903 that this chapel was dedicated to St. Saviour, the event being fully described in the "Bloemfontein Post" of July 9, 1903. Father Sanderson from Modderpoort conducted the service, at which were also present the Rector of Ficksburg, Father Kelly, Provincial Superior of the S.S.M., and the Reverend L. W. Olive, the Priest-in-Charge.
</p>
<p>

The "Quarterly Papers" of October 1903 gave the following extract from the "Bloemfontein Post".
</p>
<p>

"The Reverend Father Kelly gave a very practical and thoughtful Sermon, and the Service was of a hearty character throughout, though unfortunately the organ, a fine instrument, and most effectively played by Mr. Sam Barratt, met with an accident during the Office, so that it did not finish with the "Hallelujah Chorus" as had been intended."...
</p>
<p>

On September 7, 1904, another church on the farm "Prynnesberg", was dedicated to St. Andrew. This church was built by Mr. Charles Newberry for the use of the labourers from the surrounding area.
</p>
<p>

Both these churches are still in good condition, although the services at St. Saviour's have not been held on a regular basis since about 1985, only the occasional wedding or funeral now take place there. The folk from Gumtree all remember the services held at St. Saviour's, usually followed by a tea at the house afterwards.
</p>
<p>

Services at St. Andrew's have been continued to the present day, the church being now an out-station of the Church of the Holy Redeemer, Clocolan. To begin with, however, it was in the charge of Father Sanderson of Modderpoort.
</p>
<p>

Meanwhile the Boer War had affected the lives of those in Clocolan as well. In 1901 the Quarterly Papers for January reported that Mr. Stockdale, (a brother of Sister Henrietta) who had been living quictly on his farm, was now a prisoner of the Boers for the fourth time. In 1900 the Reverend Harcourt Vernon had been threatened with being commandeered in person for the front, but subsequently only his goods were commandeered. The Reverend and Mrs. Vernon, as we will note in the next chapter, were very much affected by the war.
</p>
<p>

Following the advent of the railway linc to the area, the town of Clocolan had moved to its present position, and in 190€ the "Clocolan Town Council" granted an erf to the church. In 1911 the Vestry of the Grove Church recorded a proposal by Mr. Stockdale that a committce be appointed to interview the Clocolan Town Council, with the object of having the grant of ground for a church and cemetcry transferred to the Church's Finance Board. It was also proposed to put up a fence. Mr. Vernon and Mr. Mardon were elected to have this carried out.

<p>

In 1913 the members of Vestry were considering the question of building a church at Clocolan. Initial plans for the church building appeared to be too costly and another architect was proposed, but who the architects were it is not possible to determine from the Vestry Minutes. It has been suggested that the church as it stands was designed by Sir Herbert Baker, and that the builder was a Mr. Rhode.
</p>
<p>

There is no foundation stone on the church but on June 3, 1917 the Vestry meeting were still discussing "the proposed Church", while the Annual Vestry Meeting on Easter Day, March 31, 1918, was held in St. George's Church, Clocolan. Soit would appear that St. George's Church was built in late 1917 or early 1918.
</p>
<p>

Another Church built in the Clocolan District which must not be forgotten is that at "Flora", a farm bought by Herbert Nicholson. His wife was Agnes, ne&#233; Barry, a granddaughter of Bishop Merriman. Soon after their arrival on the farm she started a Sunday School for the Black children, and begged the Modderpoort Fathers, by now the Society of the Sacred Mission, to open up work at Flora. By January 1912 there was a school and teacher there, and services were conducted fairly regularly.
</p>
<p>

A church was built, rather on the lines of abig hut, and services were conducted at Flora in the morning, then the priest would go on for an evening English service in Marquard. After this the priest would probably return to Flora for the night.
</p>
<p>

In Marquard itself services were held in the Town Hall and in the Court House. It was planned that the Anglicans would build a church on the sites given to them in Marquard, but as the Methodists started to build before the Anglicans' plans came to fruition, the Anglicans decided it would be better to pay an annual rent to use the Methodist Church.
</p>
<p>

The new church at Flora was built by Father Cyprian Thorpe of Modderpoort. This Church, dedicated to St. Francis, was consecrated and licensed by Bishop Arthur Howe-Browne on August 7, 1938. The priest to whose care it was licensed was Fr. Norman Taylor.
</p>
<p>

The story is told that on the day before the consecration, the Altar Stone was dropped and broken. Cyprian Thorpe was in tears, after preparing everything up to this point for the Consecration. He sent a message down to Gordon Nicholson telling of the calamity, and asking "What shall we donow". Back came Gordon's reply, "Cut another one." So they did, working night through till just before the Consecration Service was due to begin. Bishop Howe-Browne arrived early and, as was the case when he was hungry, was most irritable at any delay. However, the church service duly took place.
</p>
<p>

Back at St. George's in 1919, it was proposed that a "suitable tablet" be erected in the church in memory of those members of the congregation who had fallen in the European War. A design by Miss C. Stockdale was accepted in September 1920. In 1921 it was proposed that a mounting of "Verdite" be used, if obtainable. Otherwise that local men be approached with a view to getting it mounted in Burmese Teak.
</p>
<p>

The War Memorial was dedicated by Bishop Carey on Sunday April 2, 1922. On this day there was an early service at which the church was full and the Bishop gave quite a long address. Then at 10.30 there was the Confirmation Service, at which there was another address, then at 11.15 the dedication with another address. Finally Mattins and Sermon, finishing at 1 o'clock. I wonder how many parishioners would be able to Stay the course today?
</p>
<p>

During the singing of one hymn during the services, "the Bishop came to the steps and said, 'My dear friends, you are simply spoiling a beautiful hymn because you have no time, so I shall conduct you,' which he did and the hymn went much better!"
</p>
<p>

The Grove Church continued to be used for services up until about 1925, when in September of that year a meeting was held to decide on the disposal of the Grove furniture. Four seats were to go to Clocoian, the balance to Ficksburg. The organ was to be handed to Mr. A. Rudman for safe keeping.
</p>
<p>

In Clocolan the ladies were busy behind the scenes right from the beginning, and in our earliest records of the Vestry Minutes of the Grove Church we find recorded the thanks of the Vestry being expressed towards Mrs. F. Rudman and Miss Alice Rudman for their care of the church and organ playing.
</p>
<p>

The ladies of Clocolan did not at first seem aware, or did not make use of, their right to attend Vestry Meetings, as legislated at the 1914 Synod. Then in 1920, it was recorded that a few ladies had been present at a special meeting called to discuss the memorial fund. At this time it was Mrs. Clowes who was playing the organ and Mrs. Sturgess who was giving her attention to the church and flowers.
</p>
<p>

In 1921 there were no ladies present at the Vestry Meeting but in 1922 Mrs. Clowes was present, with no comments in the minutes regarding this event, while at the 1923 Vestry Meeting Mesdames E.; A.; and F. Rudman and Mrs. Clowes were present.
</p>
<p>

When it came to thanking the ladies at the Vestry Mccting of 1934, Mrs. Stockdale, Mrs. F. Rudman, Mrs. Higgs, and Mrs. Clowes names were noted, and the minutes record, "Speaking to the motion Canon Vernon warmly culogised the ladies for their splendid services to the church." These sentiments were thosc of all members and we find, in 1935, the ladies being thanked for items such as repairs to books, Sunday School Services and a successful bazaar, showing that the ladies well deserved the "eulogy".
</p>
<p>

In March 1938 it was proposed to form a "Band of Church Workers", but no mention is made as to whether this was to be formed of men and women or only ladies. Mrs. Hermanson is recorded as being clected secretary. However, no further mention is made of this body in later minutes.
</p>
<p>

Various additions in the way of furnishings were made to the St. George's Church over the years. In 1922 enquiries were made regarding a suitable font; and in 1928 Canon Vernon gave the church Bell from Keble to St. George's. In 1935 Mrs. Granville Vernon was thanked for the carpet; and in 1938 it was proposed to install electric light to replace the petrol lamps.
</p>
<p>

In 1932 the Wesleyans requested permission to hold their Sunday School in St. George's on the 2nd, 4th, and Sth Sunday, and this permission was granted.
</p>
<p>

During August 1940 the electric organ given to the church by Mrs. G.H. Vernon was installed and was played for the Services on the 3rd Sunday of the month by Mrs. Blau, who had taken on the duties of organist. At the dedication of the organ the Rector, the Reverend Findlay said that the organ was a gift to the church by amember of the congregation in memory of a sincere lover of music.
</p>
<p>

The matter of church heating was investigated in 1948, but it was 1966 before two heaters were installed, thanks to the Ladies Guild. These heaters, each two foot in length cost R54 and an additional R40 to install.
</p>
<p>

Interestingly enough, a proposal by Mr. H. W. Stockdale in 1950, to the effect that the meeting should consider sending women as delegates to Synod resulted in some discussion but the proposal was defeated on a show of hands.
</p>
<p>

The ladics in Clocolan must have been very proud of the amount raised at their bazaar in 1951/52. This amounted to 177 pounds 12 shillings and 7 pence. In the same year the All Saints Ladies Guild netted 128 pounds and 5 pence.
</p>
<p>

At the Vestry Meeting on April 15,1956, Mrs. Deane suggested the formation of a Ladies Guild and the following ladies were "nominated" to proceed with this: Mrs. Deane, Mrs. Harcourt Vernon, Mrs. Fred Rudman, Mrs. John Stockdale, Mrs. Van Blerck, Mrs. Matt Heyns, and Mrs. Andrew Heyns.
</p>
<p>

At the 1957 Vestry Mrs. Webb spoke briefly on the functions of the Women's Guild and appealed to the ladies to make it work. As the first Annual General Meeting of the Guild was held on August 8, 1958, it would appear that it took about a year to really get it going. The Chairwoman for the first year and a half was Mrs. Matt (Maric) Heyns, but then her death after 10 days in hospital resulted in Mrs. Pietersen (as Vice Chairlady) taking over for the rest of the year after which Mrs. Alice Donovan was elected to the Chair.
</p>
<p>

Right from the start this Guild was very active, raising funds through jumble sales and morning markets. A Christmas treat for children in the Location was organised at which nearly 300 children were given sweets, cool drinks, buns, plus a 6d, and the children sang Carols. A nativity play was organised at Prynnesberg and the collection received was given to be used for the purchase of new Prayer and Hymn Books. Meetings during the year varied between instructive and knitting and tea parties. In December 1959 the Guild were able to send a matemity parcel to St. Monica's in Cape Town, and also decided to work for the Case Committee of the Child Welfare in Bloemfontein which catered for poor women who were not able to provide clothing for their new-born babies. The annual maternity parcel to St. Monica's was kept up until 1965, when St. Monica's closed.
</p>
<p>

Jumble-sale followed bring-and-buy, and in turn followed by catering of refreshments at farm sales, and the money raised was used for such deserving causes as Cripple Care, St. Peter's, Grahamstown, and Cotlands in Johannesburg. Of course the Guild was also giving attention to St. George's, - a piece of carpeting was given for the church floor near the organ and a white surplice was made for the minister. In addition tea, sugar, milk and cakes were given to the Location Church to help entertain the Bishop on his visit there.
</p>
<p>

In 1961 the Guild took the St. Cross Orphanage in Maritzburg as their main concern, and this included taking an interest in a 12 year old girl at the orphanage, named Mollie Nel. Two of the Guild members wrote to her every month, and the Guild sent her a birthday present and birthday cards. In July 1962 the Guild organised a holiday for her in Clocolan.
</p>
<p>

The Guild continued their work for the Church and in 1962 paid for the installation of water in the church grounds, and as Church funds were in arrears with the Diocesan Assessment, the Guild contributed to this in 1963. A new Alb was also provided as the old one was showing signs of wear. The Guild continued to donate to their customary charities, as well as keep a watch out for other instances to whom they could show their generosity. As an example of this, the Guild made a donation to the Mayoress' fund to buy an incubator for the local maternity home.
</p>
<p>

When Mollie Nel left St. Cross to go to school at the George Hofmeyer school in Standerton, the Guild kept up their interest in her, sending her Christmas, birthday and Easter gifts, as well as writing to her. This was continued to 1968 when it was decided that, as Mollie was now about 19 years old, the Guild would discontinue their gifts to her.
</p>
<p>

The Guild took on the project of heating for the church, and the installation of the heaters was completed in 1966, all paid for by the Guild.
</p>
<p>

In 1967 the Guild organised a service for the "Womens World Day of Prayer at St. George's, inviting the Methodist ladies to join them. This proved very successful.
</p>
<p>

Also in this year the Guild contributed R200 to the Clergy Pensions Appeal.
</p>
<p>

An annual "Apron Parade" was organised in conjunction with the ladies from Marquard for a number of years. The aprons being donated to the bring-and-buy sale after the parade.
</p>
<p>

In 1969 the Guild affiliated with the Anglican Women's Fellowship, a relationship they have maintained ever since.
</p>
<p>

Many of the names mentioned in the minutes are still remembered today, in fact it is surprising how many are still members of this small Guild. Among those mentioned as Committee members over the years were Alice O' Donovan, Bertha Pietersen, Nora Heyns, Pi Stockdale, Daphne Newberry, Marthie Guiney, and Alice Kruger.
</p>
<p>

In 1961 a new Credence Table was suggested as a memorial to the late Mrs. Macaskill, as a legacy of R200 had been received from her, and in 1965 a further proposal was carried, "that the money be spent on a new Credence Table, a Rector's Chair, and new Altar Rails more in keeping with the Reredos." The Credence Table and Rector's Chair were ready by 1967.
</p>
<p>

The late Mrs. Thatcher had left the church R200 and it was proposed that the fence around the church grounds be renewed. On further discussion a low stone wall with pillars and a metal chain between the pillars was suggested. Some stone was cut at "Victory" but the stone cutter "disappeared" and things had come to a standstill by February 1969. However, at the Vestry meeting on February 15, 1970, Father Shepperson thanked all those who had helped with the erection of the walls and chains. The Chairman and Board of Ficksburg Co-operative were thanked for the stones. The remainder of the legacy was to be used to build a gate.
</p>
<p>

For many years the St. George's Ladies' Guild met at the house of Mrs. Edna Allwright until she moved to Ficksburg in 1982. The guild continued to work quietly in the background although at one stage there were only four members. Apart from continuing to pay the cleaning maid and arranging for the grass to be cut and a gardener to look after the gardens, they knitted squares and strips for blankets which were then donated to various organisations for the needy. Indeed, what strikes one very forcibly when reading through the minutes of their meetings is their dedication to working for the church and charities. Practically every meeting made mention of a donation for something relating to the church or to something done for a charitable organisation.
</p>
<p>

Another feature of the Guild meetings which has continued through the years is a "mystery parcel", which was donated by members in turn. Then the lucky member who drew the right ticket at the end of the meeting received the parcel. 
</p>
<p>

Growing seedlings and selling them was another project for raising church funds which was continued for a number of years.
</p>
<p>

In 1977 it was proposed that the property adjoining the church erf be sold but after much discussion it was decided not to sell the property but to lease it instead. Then various parishioners felt there was a need for a church hall to serve as a central meeting place in town rather than on the farms. Mr. Ronnie Rudman planted crops on the vacant lot in order to pay the rent and this, together with "tea money", had resulted in an accumulation of funds. With this a special account was opened with the Diocesan Trust Board for a Hall Fund. Although it was proposed that plans for a hall be drawn up, no further action was taken in this regard.
</p>
<p>

At the beginning of the 1980's the singing of the "Amen" at the end of a hymn was debated and the rule was laid down by the Rector that if the hymn contained a "gloria" the Amen was to be sung but not otherwise.
</p>
<p>

For many years Mrs. Lorna Grové played the organ at St. George's Church even after she moved to Ficksburg. Everyone was sad when in the 1980's she decided she no could no longer continue to play at St. George's and soon after this she moved to Pietermaritzburg.
</p>
<p>

Bible Study and Discussions were not neglected in Clocolan, and a group has met almost continuously up to the present.
</p>
<p>

In 1987 Passover Suppers were organised in Clocolan as well as in Ficksburg and Gumtree. The one in Clocolan was held at the farm "Lovedale", the home of AnnaMarie and Llewelyn Rudman, on the 9thof April, and on that evening "the heavens opened and it did rain". The road to Lovedale was like a river at the best parts and impassable for the rest. Mr. Llewelyn Rudman, barefoot and with the rain pouring down his neck, met the cars at the bottom of the hill and led them through the veld. All the cars got through and everyone enjoyed a warming "Sherry" before the Passover Supper began in eamest. Going home was easier as it was downhill and one had simply to keep the nose of the car pointed in the right direction.
</p>
<p>

Extensive repairs to St. George's Church were now necessary and these were carried out over the next few years, culminating in an all-out effort in 1990 when a sink was purchased by the ladies and installed in the vestry, electrical repairs were carried Out, a new Ceiling above the sanctuary was put in, new carpets were laid, and work commenced on the repair of the windows which had been vandalised.
</p>
<p>

A service was held out at the site of the old "Grove Church" as part of the All Saints' Centenary Celebrations in 1991, while in May of the same year the Guild met at "Libertas", the home of Peter and Patience Charlcton-Perkins. Dr. Charleton-Perkins and his wife had been depressed by staff problems on the farm and the Rector offered to conduct a "Blessing of the Home" service at the farm. Instead of a regular meetung of the Guild they joined with the Rector in the service. The labour staff joined the group in the gardens for prayers and the group then moved into the various rooms of the home and from there to the surgery. This was a most impressive and moving service which could be used more often to bless the homes of the parishioners.
</p>


<h1>PERSONALITIES</h1>

<p>

In writing a history of a particular community of this nature there are so many people who should be mentioned and yet cannot for lack of space and time. For that reason it is necessary to concentrate here on personalities who were not only well-known in the Anglican or English Community, but made their mark by being recorded as such in the Church records. Even then it is not possible to mention everyone, so here we will consider only a few, and ask forgiveness for those not mentioned.
</p>
<p>

There is a tendency in Ficksburg to forget the priest who was the first to serve this area, namely, Canon Beckett. The Quarterly Paper of the Bloemfontein Mission, dated April 1885, gave notice of his death, and on page 71 relates; "As the Clergy truly say there, "No words could rightly describe the great and good influence which he has exercised in the country, where he is called, in Dutch phrase, the 'Grandfather' of the whole district!"
</p>
<p>

We have noted, in chapter one, of the arrival of Canon Beckett in the Free State, but let us have a brief look at his background. He has fortunately left us a journal and some letters, which we hope we will be able to publish in the near future.
</p>
<p>

Canon Beckett graduated at Cambridge - B.A. 1840, M.A. 1844 - he was ordained Deacon by the Bishop of Ripon in 1840, Priest by the Archbishop of York in 1841. He was installed Canon of Cumbrae in 1852, and of the Cathedral of Bloemfontein in 1867. He held the office of Chancellor of the Diocese for some years, and, up to a few months before his death, was Rural Dean of the north-eastern district.
</p>
<p>

In Chapter one we also noted something of the Reverend Meyer and how he went to Bloemfontein to fetch his bride. Prior to her marraige she was a Miss Caroline Elizabeth Blackmore, and at the time of their marriage on January 17, 1883, she was 31 years old and he was 34.
</p>
<p>

Theodore Albert Meyer was born on April 17, 1848 and baptised at Celle (Hanover) in Germany. He was confirmed at St. Edmunds, Northampton by the Bishop of Peterborough on April 28, 1876. After coming to South Africa he was Assistant Master at St. Andrew's School in Bloemfontein before being ordained priest and coming to Ficksburg in 1882.
</p>
<p>

While in Ficksburg his wife gave birth to three children, two daughters and a son, and as we have learnt in the extracts from articles given in Chapter one, he seemed to build a very successful ministry in Ficksburg. However he and his family left very suddenly sometime after September 1886. Canon Crisp, writing of the arrival of the Reverend Robert Gresley Douglas in 1889, states, "From 1882 to 1886 a resident ministry had been established (in Ficksburg), but this had ended disastrously." This leaves us with a mystery which scems cannot be solved 100 years later.
</p>
<p>

In the Clocolan district one of the church families in this area provide an interesting story. In 1871 the Reverend Mr. Bevan, one of the clergy of the Bloemfontein Diocese, while on a visit to England, went across from Retford to have lunch at Bole with the Reverend Stockdale and his family. Henrietta Stockdale was by that time already fired with enthusiasm for the Orange Free State Mission, although still living with her parents.
</p>
<p>

The Reverend Mr. Bevan found that the youngest son, Henry Walter, who was eighteen at the time, "had not been placed at any special work or profession", so it was suggested that he should go out to the Mission Brotherhood at Modderpoort to work the farm there. This suggestion was put into effect and he arrived at Modderpoort in March 1872. However, by June 1873, Mr Stockdale found that he wanted his independence and also hoped to make a larger income for himself than he could as manager, so he set out to rent a farm, proposing to take as his partner Mr. W.H. France. So the Stockdale family came to the Clocolan district. Some years later, through the assistance of Canon HarcourtVernon of Keble, Mr. Stockdale acquired the farm, "ALMA".
</p>
<p>

Dr. Henry Taylor has written his own autobiography, so we will only record that he was a staunch member of the parish while he was in Ficksburg, taking an active part in church affairs. As Chapelry Treasurer, he was a member of the fund raising committee for the building of All Saints' Church, and was in fact responsible for the negotiations with the builder, Mr. William Dickens. The Special Vestry Meeting held on 8 May 1895, to discuss the building of the porch and vestry, was held in Dr. Taylor's surgery.
</p>
<p>

Perhaps the person who is best recorded in church annals, and who served the parish as priest the longest, both at Clocolan and Ficksburg, was the Reverend A. H. H. Vernon.
</p>
<p>

Algernon Hardolph Harcourt Vernon was born on July 7, 1858, in Notinghamshire, and was brought up in Retford, taking his B.A. degree at Keble College, Oxford, in 1882. He was the son of the Reverend Canon Evelyn H. Harcourt Vernon of Grove Hall, Retford, who for more than 10 years was the Honorary Treasurer of the Community of St. Michael and All Angels Sisterhood fund in England.
</p>
<p>

Miss Francis Harcourt- Vernon, Algernon Hardolph's sister, came out to South Africa as a mission worker in May, 1878, becoming the 2nd Mother Superior of the Community of St. Michael and All Angels in March, 1887. Her brother first came out to the Orange Free State in 1883, a year after his first marriage (to Miss Candle,) establishing a home at Bishops Glen, Bloemfontein, but after his wife died he returned to England and took holy orders.
</p>
<p>

Algemon Hardolph was ordained at Truro Cathedral in 1886 and in the same year was married to Georgina Marguerite, who originally came from New Zealand and whose maiden name was Martin. In 1891 the Reverend Harcourt Vernon was invited to become vicar of the Cathedral parish in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>

In March 1892 Archdeacon Crisp wrote in a letter as follows: 

<blockquote>On my return from Kroonstad in January, I found Mr. Vernon very much out of sorts. The heat has been unusually oppressive this year, even tous who are accustomed to it. I therefore took the parish off his hands, enabling him to get a run down to the coast. He tells me that he docs not feel himself strong enough for such a parish as Bloemfontein, but is willing to continue to take charge of it until the arrival of the Bishop.</blockquote>
    
For the uninitiated, priests may be called either 'the Reverend Father ....' or 'the Reverend Mister....', and the tendency was more to the latter at that time.
</p>
<p>

By the end of 1883 the Reverend Harcourt Vernon and his wife had left Bloemfontein and were residing near Clocolan where he had bought a farm and renamed it "Keble", after his old College. Here he established the first purebred Jersey herd in the Orange River Colony, as it was known in those days.
</p>
<p>

We have noted that by the beginning of 1894 the Reverend Vernon was also helping with services at Clocolan, and in 1898/99 he built a chapel on his farm.
</p>
<p>

The "Church Magazine" of March 15, 1899 reported as follows:

<blockquote>The Chapel is built to accommodate about a hundred persons, and great Care and taste have been exercised in the decoration of the interior. The appointments and hangings at the East end, the carved oak furniture, and the colouring of the walls, all combine to make reverently beautiful the little building, which has been set apart for worship. The walls are solidly built of the fine stone which is to be found at Keble, and the windows are on the Gothic model.</blockquote>

The Reverend Vernon explained, during his address, that the picture he had hung over the altar very aptly illustrated the great event which was their Cause of rejoicing on that day - the advent of the Saviour. The picture on the North side was a copy of one hanging in his College at Oxford, and represented the Saviour as the Light of the World.
</p>
<p>

Sunday services at Keble are still remembered by a number of people in the district. Families would travel long distances by cart and horse to Keble and then enjoy the hospitality of picnic meals supplied by the Harcourt Vernons.
</p>

</div>    

<p>

The chapel was used for special occasions as well, as for instance, in 1907, the wedding between Mr. Leonard Bigg, son of the Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, and Miss Faulkes, a cousin of one of the judges in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>

This Chapel was used for a number of years but, unfortunately, in these latter years it has degenerated into a store room, although at the time of writing, the present owners have expressed their intention of restoring it as a chapel.
</p>
<p>

During the Boer War the Reverend and Mrs. Vernon, like many others in the area, were Often quite cut off from communication with the outside world, the Boers visiting them from time to time but not seriously interfering with them. However, by October 1901, the Reverend Vernon and his family had been obliged to leave their home and were living inthenew St. Andrew's College in Bloemfontein. The Reverend Vernon was therefore able to assist with services at the Cathedral during their stay in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>

In 1915 the sad news was received of the death of the second son of the Reverend Vernon, killed in action in German East Africa on June Sth. His older brother, Granville, was with the forces in German South-West Africa.
</p>
<p>

Apart from these two sons, Reverend Vernon had a daughter from his first marriage, Kate, who married Captain Dugald Stewart Gilkison of the Scottish Rifles. The Reverend and Mrs Georgina Vernon also had two daughters, Marjorie, who married Ritchie Moffett, and Dorothy, who never married.
</p>
<p>

In 1925 the Bishop proposed that the Reverend Vernon take responsibility for Ficksburg as the Reverend Griggs had left. At the Vestry meeting on 26 April 1925, this proposal was put to the members of Vestry and the opinion was expressed that the Reverend Vernon was too old aman for the parish. It should be remembered that by this date he was about 67 years old, so one can understand their concern. However, when one considers that Father Vernon served the parish until his death in December 1936, as a much respected and beloved priest, the parish should be pleased that when put to
the vote the motion was carried for the Reverend Harcourt Vernon to be accepted.
</p>
<p>

As an indication of the regard held for him by the clergy of the Diocese at large, the Reverend Algernon Hardolph Harcourt Vernon was elected a Canon of Bloemfontein Cathedral in 1931.
</p>
<p>

In 1939 an Altar and Riddle Posts were dedicated in All Saints' Church on September 17, 1939 by the Bishop of Bloemfontein, the Right Reverend A.H. Howe-Browne, as a memorial to Canon Vernon. The Altar was designed by the Reverend Father Norman Taylor of the Society of the Sacred Mission at Modderpoort. The Altar and its surroundings were Carried out in teak with omamentation in colour and gilding, the arms of the Harcourt Vernon family being the chief motif on the Riddle Posts.
</p>
<p>

Mrs Vernon's influence among the parishioners and particularly the children, was outstanding. During the many years the Reverend Vernon laboured in this area for the Church he was helped unceasingly and devotedly by his wife. Mrs Georgina Marguerite Harcourt Vernon passed peacefully away at her home "The Loquats" on July 27th, 1951.
</p>
<p>

The Bowie family name is found throughout the parish records right from the early days of Ficksburg and one member whose whole life was spent in association with Ficksburg was Charles Ward Bowie. Bom at the old homestead, Morgen-Zon, in 1876, the second son of John and Margaret Bowie, Charles started his education at St. John's School in Ficksburg, which had been started by the Reverend Meyer. At an early age Charles was then sent to the Grove, Claremont, which was a preparatory school for the Diocesan College (Bishops), which later moved to Rondebosch. In those days the nearest railhead was at Kimberley, and Charles and his brother had to be taken from Ficksburg to Kimberley by Cape cart in order to make the long journey to Cape Town by themselves.
</p>
<p>

Charles returned to farm at Morgenzon when he was 18 years old, his elder brother having died the year before. Here he continued to farm until his death one day before his 82nd birthday.
</p>
<p>

The first mention of organists at Ficksburg was in the minutes of the Vestry meeting on May 5, 1891, when Mr. Herbert Mitchely was sent 5 pounds as a gift for his playing the organ during the past year. As the first service in All Saints' Church was on May 17 of that year, the organist must have been active in St. Columba's Church.
</p>
<p>

In 1895 Miss MacAskill is mentioned as organist, and singing practice was in full swing in 1896.
</p>
<p>

As Sunday School teachers, we first have mention of Miss R. MacAskill in January 1896, and she was assisted by Miss A. Donald. In 1897 the Sunday School teachers were Miss Cooke and Miss Dormel.
</p>
<p>

In March, 1897 the organist, Miss Louisa Macaskill was married to Jacob Frederick Siebert. She left to live in Bloemfontein, and was presented with a cheque and a gold watch from the church officials and congregation. Also "a silver salver and tea service very handsomely engraved, and a most beautiful centre-piece in silver open work and pink glass. "
</p>
<p>

Miss Alice Margaret Donnell then took over the organ until in May of the same year she married Mr. Alexander Ferdinand Wande of Spitzkop. Thereupon Mrs. E.A. Snell, wife of the Churchwarden offered her services, but in August 1898 the Churchwarden and his family left Ficksburg, and All Saints' was without an organist. A Miss or Mrs Macaskill then played until 1905 when she resigned.
</p>
<p>

Mrs Dalton played for a short while until Mrs Siebert could take over as organist in 1906. During 1909 there is arecord of a choir, apparently conducted by Mr. Leysath until he and his wife left the parish to take up residence in Basutoland at the end of 1912. The choir continued for some years. In the December copy of the "Church Magazine", congratulations were offered to the choir for their beautiful rendering of Stainer's Anthem, "What are These", at the Festival Services. In January 1910 the same magazine commented on the excellent rendering of the Anthem by Norman Churchill, "Behold, I Bring You Good Tidings", sung at the Christmas Services.
</p>
<p>

The choir lost one of its members in March, 1910, however, when Miss Muriel Snell was married to Mr. Philip Macaskill, and the couple set up home at Erfdeel, in the District of Senekal. Miss Snell was presented with a teapot and an address of congratulation from the choir. Miss E. Phillimore and Miss L. Mitchell also left the choir.
</p>
<p>

Sull in 1910, the services at the All Saints' Festival were well attended, the Church being decorated with the earliest Arum Lilies, and the choir sang "Woodward's Communion Service", and the Anthem, "Sun of my Soul".
</p>
<p>

In 1914/15, Mr. D'Athplayed the organ after which Miss H. Tennent and Miss I. Wille took over for a short while. Mrs Snell then played with Ina Wille playing in her absence, but by 1919 we have Mrs. Long as organist.
</p>
<p>

Thereafter, although the organist is often thanked at the annual vestry meeting, noname is mentioned until 1929, when the Church Wardens were asked to write to thank Mrs. P. Wille for her services at the organ. In 1930 Mesdames Wright, P. Wille and Van der Westhuizen were thanked, and in 1932 the name of Prestwick was added to this list, and by 1935 the names of Mrs J. Tennent and Beryl Macaskill were included.
</p>
<p>

In 1940 we once again find the name of Mr. Leysath mentioned as choirmaster, while the voluntary organists were Mrs. Leysath, Mrs. P. Wille, Mrs. Tennent, and Miss Tennent. Mr. Leysath continued as choirmaster until his death on Easter Eve 1947. Mrs. Theresa Bnits also played the organ at one time, as well as being a member of the choir.
</p>
<p>

"Granny" Tennent, as she was affectionately known by all, came to Ficksburg with her husband from Scotland, where she had studied music and began playing the church organ. She played at weddings in Ficksburg for somany years that she eventually found herself playing at the weddings of children of couples at whose wedding she had played years before. The Harmonium at All Saints' was of the "pedal it yourself" varicty until, in order to make it easier for Mrs Tennent, the organ was fitted with an electric blower.
</p>
<p>

Mrs. P. Wille and Mrs. Tennent continued as organists for a number of years and in 1958 Miss Cedar Sorour joined them, but in 1965 a crisis was reached when no organist was available and Miss K. Tennent stepped in to help out although she said she preferred tolead the singing rather than take on the task of organist on a permanent basis. In 1967 the Annual Vestry Minutes reported that the problem of the organist had been solved by arrangements being made with Mrs. Gilliland to play at certain services for a small fee.
</p>
<p>

In March 1970 the proposal was made to ask Miss Cedar Sorour to play on the 1st Sunday of the month. Cedar agreed to do this. In 1973 the council minutes record that it was always difficult to find an organist and it was decided that hymns would be sung only at Easter, Christmas, and on special occasions. However, Miss Sorour continued to play the organ on a regular basis except when she was on holiday. Mrs. Marietjie Sorour also started to play when Cedar was not available.

<h1>BRINDISI AND FOURIESBURG</h1>

<p>

In his book, "Doctor to Basuto, Boer and Briton", Dr Henry Taylor relates of his arrival in South Africa. On his arrival in Bethlehem his bag was seized by a man whose name turned out to be Middleton. The son of this Mr. Middleton took Dr. Taylor to Mr. C. Middleton's house in Basutoland, a few hundred yards from the Caledon river, where, instead of a large comfortable bed in a large home which were the expectations of this new comer to the country, Dr. Taylor was kindly offered a share of the floor space in the store along with other travellers.
</p>
<p>

This is our first reference to a name with which the Church in the Fouriesburg area has been associated night from the beginning through to the present day. An example of a Sunday routine by the Vicar of Bethlehem is given for June 3, 1894, in "The Church Magazine" for that month. "Mattins were said at 11 o'clock, and was followed by a celebration of Holy Communion, when seven persons received the Blessed Sacrament. Evensong was said at 3 o'clock, to allow persons coming from a distance time to reach home before sunset. Both services were well attended, several of the congregation coming from Fouriesburg; others from Basutoland. Mr. and Mrs. Middleton were most kind, making everyone (as usual) welcome."
</p>
<p>

In his letter of June 21, 1896, published in the Quarterly Papers of July of that year, Bishop Hicks wrote, "On Tuesday, June 9, I went to Brindisi, where I was met by the Rector of Bethlehem, who holds services there periodically. Brindisi is a large trading establishment belonging to Mr. Charics Middleton, a loyal and earnest churchman, whoentertained us mosthospitably. The next day we drove to Fouriesburg, a small township which has sprung up in the last four years. Here we breakfasted, and I confirmed two persons, and then we went on to Bethlehem."
</p>
<p>

The Reverend W.H. Ball, writing from Bethlehem in 1897, relates that on first arrival in Bethlehem he paid only quarterly visits to Brindisi, but later added Fouriesburg as well as Senekal and Reitz as places that HAD to be visited.
</p>
<p>

In 1899 he wrote of the valuable work Mrs. Snell had carried out in organising two concerts in Fouriesburg with the help of Mr. C.E. Middleton and Company from Brindisi, in order to raise funds for a Harmonium. He writes in the October "Church Magazine", "It is sorely needed. After along drive, perhaps in the face of a strong wind, it is most trying to have to visit the village, then take service, read the psalms, canticles, lessons, preach, and probably START, if not SING, all the hymns."
</p>
<p>

In 1906 services were being taken in Fouriesburg by the Reverend W. Stevenson of Sekubu. He took services once a month for a while at least, and in return the people at Fouriesburg guaranteed him 50 pounds per annum and expenses, thus providing the salaries of two catechists.
</p>
<p>

However, in 1907 the Rector of Bethlehem, Archdeacon Vincent, had resumed taking services at Fouriesburg He was assisted by the Reverend W.O. Wellington who Came out to South Africa in that year.
</p>
<p>

In October 1908 we find that the "Fouriesburg Christy Minstrel Troupe" gave the proceeds of their entertainment to the Anglican Church Building Fund, and just before the service on Sunday, June 13, 1909, Archdeacon Vincent convened a meeting of the Anglican Church congregation and supporters with the object of ascertaining whether an effort could be made to provide Fouriesburg with a small church. It was estimated that this would cost about 400 pounds, with another 50 pounds for furnishing. Services had, up to this date, all been held in the Town Hall. Those present were in sympathy with the idea and a committee was formed of about 16 men with a ladies committee of about 12. The first joint meeting was held in the Court House on Wednesday, June 16, at 3 p.m.
</p>
<p>

The Foundation Stone of St. Mary's Church was laid on Wednesday, November 12, 1911, by Mrs. C.E. Middleton. Mr. Andrews carved the stone as a gift to the Church. Almost all the congregation from town and country were present as well as those referred to as "friends", and a special service was conducted by Archdeacon Vincent.
</p>
<p>

By April 16, 1912, the church had been completed and was dedicated by Bishop Arthur Chandler "to the Glory and Worship of God and the memory of St. Mary the Virgin." The Church Magazine reported the event , saying that a large congregation had attended, many coming from as far as Bethlehem. The Reverend B.L. Hope acted as Bishop's Chaplain, and Archdeacon Vincent and Canon Orford also took part.
</p>
<p>
In 1914 the name of Middleton again crops up when the ordination of Edmund Middleton to the diaconate was fixed for March 8. The Quarterly Papers of April 1914 reported as follows: 

<blockquote>Edmund Middleton, son of a much respected Free State family, was ordained Deacon on the Second Sunday in Lent (March 8) by Bishop Balfour. The Chancellor, Canon Orford, presented the candidate and preached the sermon, expressing thankfulness that they were that day setting apart for the ministry of Christ's Church one born in the country....</blockquote>
</p>

    <div class="figcaption">St. Mary's Church, Fouriesburg</div>
</div>

<p>

After ordination Mr. Middleton, who attended St. Paul's, Grahamstown, went to Mafeteng to take up work there under Canon Ford. He was ordained priest in 1916.
</p>
<p>
The St. Mary's Women's Guild came into being at a meeting held in 1957 at Mrs. Frost's house, and conducted by Mrs. Webb. However, as with the other churches, the ladies had been involved with the church activities and fund raising right from the early days of the church in Fouriesburg. Unfortunately, no minutes of those early days are now available to tcll us of their deeds.
</p>
<p>
At the meeting on May 22, 1957, Mrs. Webb explained the purpose of a Women's Church Guild and it was agreed that the women of St. Mary's and friends should form such a guild. Officers were then elected with Mrs. E.R. Middleton as President, Mrs. Thresher as Vice-President and Mrs. Gasson was elected Secretary/Treasurer. 
</p>
<p>
The Guild immediately started making plans for fund raising. The first project was a jumble sale, while a Christmas play was also enthusiastically proposed, to be held on December 18th in the Town Hall. The money from this tableau went to St. Faith's Home in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>
Meetings were held each month except the school holiday months of July and January, to be held at different members' homes at 10 a.m. and with two ladies being responsible for teas. However, it would seem that most meetings were held at Mrs. Frost's house.
</p>
<p>
Initial items presented to the church were a candle snuffer and tapers donated by one of the Guild members, and a new carpet runner and underfelt. Charities included the Widows and Orphans fund and the Modderpoort Clinic Appeal. Old Christmas cards were also collected for "Cripple Care" in East London.
</p>
<p>
It was decided to discuss different topics at Guild meetings and the first topic chosen was Church Vestments. This triggered off a move to work on the St. Mary's vestments, but the discussion of various topics did not really get off the ground. The Guild also accepted the responsibility of paying the organist, and purchasing new Prayer and Hymn books.
</p>
<p>
In 1961 the Guild took on the organisation for the celcbration of the jubilee year of St. Mary's. To start with they arranged for Mr. Reuder of Ficksburg to make a Reredos for the church, to be paid for by the Guild. This was Dedicated by the Bishop on October 15th. A Finger Supper was arranged by the Guild on 11th November to which all the Fouriesburg V.I.P.'s were invited, as well as past ministers and Church Wardens. This was followed by a play titled "See How They Run", produced by the Reverend Mr. Stewart with the Ficksburg Dramatic Society. This was acclaimed a great SUCCESS.
</p>
<p>
In 1962 the Ficksburg Dramatic Society, amongst whom were many members of the All Saints' congregation, gave a production of "Ten Little Niggers", which was thoroughly enjoyed by all who could attend.
</p>
<p>
By 1962 the Guild were feeling that they could not achieve as much as they had in the past as they had lost a number of members, including Mrs. J. Middleton, who had resigned. A number of others had either left Fouriesburg or died. However, in 1963 the Guild finally took the plunge and arranged for the "Womens World Day of Prayer" service to be held in St. Mary's church. Mrs. Pat Stewart led the service and in spite of all the misgiving which the Guild had felt at arranging an ecumenical event of this nature in the Anglican Church, it was a great success and extra chairs had to be borrowed from the school.
</p>
<p>
The Guild still managed to reach very high fund raising targets, with activities such as jumble sales and cake stalls. They contributed towards the Ordination Fund and the Church Assessment, which was greatly appreciated by the Parish Council. It should also be noted that it was quite routine to invite the "Padre" to lunch after the Sunday services, a tradition which was maintained for many years.
</p>
<p>
As with the St. George's Guild, the St. Mary's Guild were persuaded to become members of the Anglican Women's Fellowship in 1970, and in June 1971 a gathering of all the women of the Parish, including Ficksburg, Marquard, Clocolan, Gumtree. Bethlehem and Harrismith, was held at the home of Mrs. Thresher at "Klein Thaba Bosigo". The meeting was addressed by the Provincial Chairlady, Mrs. Ferguson, and the Vice-Chair, the Rev. Mother Mary Ruth.
</p>
<p>
In 1971 St. Mary's celebrated its 60th anniversary and the St. Mary's Women's Guild donated a notice board in commemoration. The Anniversary celebrations consisted of a lunch held at "Wynford" after the service on the Sth Sunday in October. The plan had been to play tennis, bowls, etc., but a severe hailstorm prevented this. However, an interesting talk on "the old days", was given by Mr. Charles Middleton and his family.
</p>
<p>
In 1972 cloakroom additions to the vestry were completed, and it was about this timc that the Guild started to make cnquirics about the possible use of the vacant erven next to the church as a long eerm project. The two erven were then donated to the church by Mr. Charles Middleton. Among the ideas for the use of the erven were, the building of a holiday cottage for clergy, and flats for the elderly.
</p>
<p>
In 1972 the ladies took up cudgels in connection with the new Fouriesburg bypass road. Their concern was for the two intcrsections at which the Fouriesburg traffic wouldenter the by-pass. They felt these were dangerous and that fly-over bridges should be built. They therefore set out to write letters to the local Member of Parliament, the A.A., Rondalia, and others. Encouraging replies were received from the A.A., and Rondalia, as well as from Mr. Keyter M.P. The Provincial Roads Engineer, Bloemfontein, in his reply, stated that the crossings were perfectly satisfactory. The Guild considered this reply unsatisfactory.
</p>
<p>
Also in 1972 the Guild started to sponsor a local child named 'Dominic'. He had been living on one of the farms in the Founiesburg district but his mother had gone away, his father had been killed by lightning, and he and two brothers were being cared for by his grandfather, who was going blind. The boy was to be sent to school and the teacher was asked to report on his progress periodically. Clothes were bought for him, as well as books.
</p>
<p>
On September 12, 1972, the Guild paid a visit to Witzieshoek, to see the work being done there. They felt that this was a worthwhile and informative day. The Ficksburg ladies also invited the St. Mary's A.W.F. to tea in October.
</p>
<p>
Official records of the years until 1985 are now missing, but in that year the Methodists, who use St. Mary's Church for Sunday services, were instrumental in having electricity installed in the church.
</p>
<p>
In 1987 the 75th anniversary of St. Mary's Church was celebrated with a braai in the church grounds. This has been followed up in subsequent years with an annual picnic braai at the farm "Ettrick", home of Margie and Denton Osler.
</p>
<p>
The Bible Study Group meetings had grown spasmodic owing to absenteeism and illness of the hostess, and finally stopped about 1988. This was much regretted and efforts were made to revive the group, but as the members lived so far apart, this has proved difficult.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the fact that the average age of the congregation was moving up the scale caused the lack of heating in the church in winter to become a major issue. Investigation led to the feeling that electric heaters would be the most suitable but that this would require additional electrical wiring in the church.
</p>
<p>
St. Mary's became a film location with the filming of the television series "Meester". In 1989 the film company requested the use of the church for part of the filming which would be carried out in the Fouriesburg - Clarens area. The church scene for the film was made after removal of the gutters of the church and the erection of what looked like a gallows near the entrance to the church. This turned out to be a structure for hanging a church bell at a height which could easily be seen during the filming. The fcncing around the church also had to be removed and replaced after the filming. With the advent of new gutters a move was Started to have the church properly renovated.
</p>
<p>
In 1990, in the week before Easter, the church and vestry were broken into. Vestments, candles and the silverware were among the items stolen. Fortunately the inventory was up to date, the insurance company paid out the claim, and replacement of the stolen goods could take place. Mr. Ted Middleton, son of that same Edmund Middleton ordained in 1916 and who had spent many years in the ministry in Leribe, presented his father's chalice and paten to take the place of that which was stolen.
</p>
<p>
Repairs to the church now took place in eamest and a three-phase electrical system replaced the single phase so that electrical heaters could be used.
</p>
<p>
Hopes were high during this period that the Highveld Water Scheme would result in more Anglican members, both at St. Mary's and at All Saints', but the few that did come did not make up in number for those who had left the area. Nevertheless the parishioners of St. Mary's continue to make every effort to continue the worship in their little church in Fouriesburg.

<p>
The Reverend Meyer wrote in his letter of January 1884 which has been previously referred to, "Thus I found it (the Church), and you would be surprised to see what a dear little place it makes, and how churchlike everything looks init. There is a proper altar, seven feet long, with a little wooden cross, two small candlesticks, altar vases and dossal, with red curtains each side, and a credence table. We follow the cathedral use in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>
We had the dais and altar steps floored and carpeted for Christmas. The little building has a thatch roof and wooden cross; and standing near a large willow, it has a very neat and rustic appearance." This, then, was St. Columba's Church, Ficksburg.
</p>
<p>
It is interesting to speculate on the reason for dedicating this church to St. Columba, and the following extract from the Quarterly Paper of the Orange Free State Mission of May, 1868, just may have some bearing on the matter.
</p>
<p>
"There is a quiet spot where the good work of Bishop Twells is often thought of, and where a desire has been felt to assist it. This spot is S. Columba's College, near Dublin. We know that, as one of the Bishop's earliest spheres of labour, it is affectionately remembered by him, and that though his pupils and colleagues have long since passed on to other fields of life, many of them, as well as of the present members, feel the link that connected him with their college, and are proud of the higher position which he now occupies."
</p>
<p>
The article continues by stating that the annual offertory in the chapel would be devoted to the Bloemfontein Mission, and that they had sclected the new church at Philippolis as the recipient of that year's offertory, and that future offertorics would be sent to other places in the Orange Free State. Is it just possible that the church in Ficksburg was the subject of a contribution, thus bringing about the decision to dedicate the church to St. Columba?
</p>
<p>
We have seen that a parsonage was bought for the new parson who was to live in Ficksburg and the Reverend Mr. Meyer described it in his letter of January 1884 as follows.

<blockquote>The parsonage is what we call here a large house, four rooms, a passage, and a kitchen; the rooms are of good size. The house was very dirty and dilapidated when I first came; mud floors, broken windows, no locks, no steps, mud walls, no ceiling, and horrid insects by thousands. Outside, the building looked as bad; no guttering, the brick window sills washed out, the brick and mortar of the walls wom away in places. So I had to set to work with a heavy heart and light purse to mend and finish the house, which cost about 250 pounds. But now it is a very respectable house, all the rooms are floored and ceilinged, and the walls of all but one room painted; the outside has been roughcast...</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
When it was decided to build the new church of All Saints' the Building Committee met several mes. Thereupon Mr. William Dickens, a builder in Ficksburg, was Offered the existing church and the erf on which it stood in part payment for the building of the new church. Mr. Dickens accepted this proposal. "The church to be built of burnt brick, of dimensions fifty feet long by twenty feet wide and fourteen feet high with an apsidal East end, each side of the apse being ten feet. The brickwork to be eighteen inches thick throughout". The building was to be completed within six months.
</p>
<p>
By November 1890 the foundation of the church had been laid, and on January 9, 1891 the foundation stone was laid by the Reverend Father Douglas, Canon of Bloemfontein and Rector of Modderpoort.
</p>
<p>
"It was eventually decided to substitute a wooden floor for the proposed antheap one, and all the woodwork was entrusted by Mr. Dickens to Mr. Carmichael who did it excellently but slowly".
</p>
<p>
Mr. Michael Wille relates how he was told that the parishioners helped in the building of the church after working hours.
</p>
<p>
Having discussed the matter at the Vestry mccting three years earlier, it was proposed on 8 May 1895 that the porch and vestry should be built and that a Mr. Harvey could do the building. Consequently a request dated July 1, 1895 was sent to the Bishop asking for the issuc of a faculty to build a porch and vestry for the chapel of All Saints', Ficksburg. The request was signed by the Vicar, F. M. Lane, and Mr. H. Foxcroft, Chapelwarden. The new porch and vestry were begun in the weck of June 23, 1895.
</p>
<p>
On July 27, 1910 a very enjoyable dance was held in the Town Hall with the object of raising moncy for the church to be repainted.
</p>
<p>
By 1929 the time had come for gencral renovations to the church and in 1930 this was started. This included painting, the insertion of tic-rods and "letting the electric wire tubes into the walls".
</p>
<p>
Repairs to the plaster in the church were a continual necessity and in 1953 it was suggested that the church should be pancelicd instead of replastering. It is interesting to note that the suggestion was to panel the church with "rhino board". No panelling had beencamied out by 1956 and it was then proposed by Mr. S. Sorour that a fund be started to build a new church. Although some fund raising was started in this connection nothing definite was done about a new church, repairs to the existing church and the addition of a vestry taking precedence.
</p>
<p>
At the Annual Vestry meeting in 1962 Mr. Charles Bowie addressed the meeting and after bringing the meeting's attention to the existing New Church Building Fund, stated that steps would have to be taken as the life of the present building was ending, although it would still be usable for a while, giving time for consideration of the New Church to be made. In his opinion the existing building would need major reconstruction and not merely repair and alteration. After lengthy discussion no definite decision was reached by the meeting.
</p>
<p>
During 1970 agreement was finally reached to panel the walls of the church instead of replastering. In addition, the wall between the church and the vestibule-vestry section at the west cnd would be opened up and a new vestry built. As usual, the decision was followed by a lot of inactivity and it was 1972 before work started.
</p>
<p>
Neon lighting now replaced the old electric lamps except for one of the sanctuary lamps which was hung in the entrance to the church. The floors were also sanded and sealed with a proprietary sealer. Wooden tops to the half-walls which had been left to separate the main body of the church and the entrance were made although these took a couple of years to be completed. The renovations and building of the new vestry on the south side was finally completed in 1973. Finally curtains were hung "between the nave and the vestibule". During these rather major renovations church services were held in the Methodist church.
</p>
<p>
When we enquire about the "Grove Church" in the Clocolan district we learn that Brother Arthur of St. Augustine's, Modderpoort helped them to convert an 'ordinary' dwelling house into alittle chapel, the original kitchen being converted to the vestry.
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Vincent wrote: "The old Square windows were removed, and six orthodox lancet windows put in. The floor was of earth, so a boarded floor was put down and the chancel raised. The walls outside, plastered with lime, and the inside plaster has all been removed and donc up fresh". Various fricndsin England andelsewhcere sent Altar Linen, Altar Frontal, Communion Service, Cross, Candlesticks, and other items.
</p>
<p>
Once is struck, when reading Mr. Vincent's Iettcrs, at the endeavour to "do it nght" even to the replacement of the square windows with "orthodox lancet windows". I wonder if we would bother today, were we to usc a convericd, rented house ?
</p>
<p>
The "Quarterly Papers" of October 1903 gave the following extract from the "Bloemfontein Post" to describe St. Saviour's Church at Prynnesberg:

"The Church is a most beautiful stone building of Early English architecture, with cusped window heads and abundance of carving in stone (executed by Mr. Cooper) of the very finest descnption. A stone chancel-arch of graceful proportions springs from the carved capitals of stone pillars at either side, with rather an elaborately timbered roof, whose principal rafters rest upon carved corbels, and whose intermediate rafters are carried on arches omamented above with open perpendicular work (executed by Mr. Harvey). The font designed by Miss Newberry, is of an unique and beautiful character, made up of three clustered pilasters with the carved capitals supporting the bowl. The whole work has been carried out for Chas. Newberry, Esq., and presented by him to the Church of the Province of South Africa, and will be a great boon to the neighbourhood."
</p>
<p>
The building which we know today as "The Hall" at All Saints' does not have its Origins recorded. This small building, in the grounds of the church near the Rectory, probably had its origins in a room or couple of rooms in which the visiting guest from Modderpoort could stay in the days before the Parsonage was bought.
</p>
<p>
It may also have been where the Reverend Olive lived when he was resident in Ficksburg, as the Parsonage was at that stage let out. On the other hand he may have owned his own house in town, although that is unlikely and no mention of it is found in the records. The first reference which MAY refer to this building was in 1897, when at the Vestry it was proposed "..... that a convenience be put up for the Cottage". This was erected against the fence below the hall. In 1910, again, when discussing the Ladies Work Party which had just restarted, it was mentioned that they were meeting in the Church Cottage.
</p>
<p>
Parishioners still remember the building being occupied, however, and amongst these occupants at one time or another were Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, who owned the Ficksburg News at one time, and Mr. and Mrs. Webster.
</p>
<p>
In those earlier days the entrance to the building was from the cast end, and onc had to approach up an incline to enter. This entrance was closed later when it was turned into a parish hall.
</p>
<p>
In 1951 the building was being uscd as a Study and Workshop, and at the Reverend Chatficld's suggestion, work was putin hand totum it into asmall parish hall. This work included two windows being fitted, the middle wall removed, the ceiling repaired, the fireplace moved, plastering to be donc inside and outside and the gultering repaired.
</p>
<p>
In 1973 plans were made for the addition of a kitchenette and toilets. These changes and gencral renovations took placc at the same time as the building of the new Rectory.
</p>
<p>
There was at one time a Structure in the church grounds known as "the Summerhouse". It stood approximately where the Garden of Remembrance is today, and consisted of cight polcs holding up a thatched roof. The floor was raised from the ground and was of wood flooring. Estimates of its size give it at about three meters by six meters, and it had canvas sides which could be rolled down to keep out the wind.
</p>
<p>
The origin of the building seems to have gone back to the days when parishioners from the farms used to come in for the church services and stay for the day, bringing picnic lunches.
</p>
<p>
In the 1926 Vestry minutes reference was made to the Sunday scholars in providing funds for the erection of "the substantial shelter in the Rectory grounds", and one wonders if this was not the Summerhouse, as the Rectory grounds and the church grounds were extensions of each other.
</p>
<p>
The Summerhouse gave a shelter in which to sit, talk, and eat. Once motor Cars Came to town, or should we say, came to the farms, in eamest, the need tended to fall away, but the Summerhouse continued to be used for other purposes, such as Ladies' Guild Meetings, and other activities. In 1952, after the changes to the Hall made that building a suitable place to hold meetings, the Summerhouse fell into disuse. In time it deteriorated and was finally demolished in 1973, some of the wood going to Gumtree and the rest sold to Mr. Herne.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Taylor's house was on the erf in Lang street from Piet Retief to Kestell Streets, the house still standing at No.31. Other doctors took over the property unt it was bought by Miss Fawkes who built on the section adjoining Piet Retief Street. This house was known as the Loquats, and it was eventually bought by Mr. and Mrs. Granville Harcourt Vernon for Canon and Mrs. Harcourt Vernon to stay in as the existing Rectory in Pict Reticf Surect was considered too damp. The house passed into the hands of Miss Dorothy Vernon, who in turn sold it to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Tennent.
</p>
<p>
The Parsonage was rented out during Canon Vernon's stay in the Loquats, but taken over by the Reverend Findlcy when he and his wife came to Ficksburg in 1937. In 1941 the Ladies Guild agitated for a new Rectory, the minutes of the Parish Council of February 1943 recorded that a Ietter from the Ladies Guild "briefly urged the council to take immediate steps for the beticr accommodating of the rector and his family." Furthermore the letter said that, "they feel most strongly that the present rectory is a disgrace to the parish."
</p>
<p>
The ladies' comments were taken seriously and consideration was given to building a new rectory or buying another house. Unfortunately the cost of a new rectory appeared to be beyond the means of the congregation and after trying to get some support from Clocolan and Marquard towards the cost of buying a house, without success, it was decided that the least that could be done was renovating the existing rectory and improving it. This was to include the addition of an extra room and a stoep, which it was later decided to enclose with glass. The Clocolan congregation agreed to contribute towards the cost of these improvements.
</p>
<p>
By the time the Reverend Wheat arrived in 1946 further renovations to the rectory were necessary. After these were carried out the roof was sull found to be leaking, the explanation given by the builders being, "the rafters are too rotten to hold the screws".
</p>
<p>
In 1947 the proposal was again put forward to build a new Rectory, members of Vestry maintaining that no further money be spent on trying to renovate the existing Rectory. A concerted effort was made over the next few years to raise funds for the purpose of building but no other action was taken.
</p>
<p>
In 1950 the Horticultural Society made an offer to buy a small portion of the Rectory erf for the purpose of building a hall. After much discussion this proposal was not accepted, but in the process the Rectory erf was tentatively divided up on paper as follows; 

<blockquote>
    "A", the top third, next to the Trade School grounds, measuring 150 x 100 fect; 
    "B", the next third down, of the same size; 
    "C", the half of the remainder, on the corner and including the outbuildings, measuring 75 x 100 feet; and 
    "D", the remaining sixth, of the same size, on which the Rectory stands.
</blockquote>

It was decided to test the value of this property on the open market, in portions and as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Various offers were made for the ground and while discussions surrounding the matter of a new Rectory were taking place the possible purchase of a house belonging to Mr.D. Tobias in Zon Street came before the council which again led to a complete re-thinking of the matter. In the middle of all this, the Reverend Wheat accepted the position of Rector of Kroonstad, leaving Ficksburg in the middle of 1951. His place in Ficksburg was taken by the Reverend B. G. Chatfield.
</p>
<p>
A Vestry Meeting was called at which everyone agreed that the building of a new Rectory was not feasible. The final result was that the old Rectory was sold and the house in Zon Street purchased.
</p>
<p>
Painting and repairs of the Zon Street rectory were carried out from time to time in the 1960's and in September 1969 it was suggestcd that this rectory be sold instead of carrying out major altcrations to the building. A special vestry meeting was held on October 25, 1970 to approve the sale of the Zon Surcet rectory and to build a new rectory on the church property in Lang Street. Further vestry meetings were considered necessary in 1971 and the old rectory was finally sold in July 1973, the rector and his family moving into temporary accommodation in Visser street.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Derrick Macaskill reminisces over the days he spent bulldozing the grounds in preparation for the new rectory building while scores of onlookers stood on the sidelines. Building of the new rectory and alterations to the hall were started in October 1973, the building contractor being Mr. Willem Smit. The building was not completed in the six months stipulated in the contract and it was July 1974 before Canon Shepperson and his family could move in. This was to be only a short stay for them as they left Ficksburg in December of the same year.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Helen Dickson provided a plan of the rectory and surrounding gardens with suggestions for the layout of the garden. This included brick and gravel pathways and stone supporting walls. Other workers in the grounds included Mr. H. Schultd, who cleared tree stumps and trimmed the oak trees, and Mr. R. Cierenberg who ploughed the grounds.
</p>
<p>
The official opening of the Rectory by the Bishop was held on Saturday, 19 October 1974.
</p>
<p>
The laying of the brick paths and driveway by Mrs. Helen Dickson was completed before the Reverend Daile Pillans and his wife moved into the new Rectory.
</p>
<p>
The Rectory courtyard was improved in September 1978 with a face-brick wall and grille gate in the west end, and a pergola supported on piers. Misunderstanding regarding money spent on brick paving gave rise to "some very acrimonious and heated discussion."
</p>
<p>
In 1979 cracks started to appear in the walls of the passage. This was eventually found to be due to a burst pipe under the cement in the courtyard, but there was a lot of investigation and many theories aired before the cement was dug up in 1980 and the burst pipe found. The cement was removed, the pipe was repaired, and the courtyard was re-bricked with loose bricks on sand.
</p>
<p>
In 1898 it was recorded that the congregation had for some time believed that the Church windows ought to be coloured in some way so as to subdue the very intense light.
</p>
<p>
Promises were made, books of coloured designs were obtained, and even estimates, and four windows promised by gentlemen ("rarely attending the services, and who certainly are not those incommodcd by the glare", according to the Vicar). Finally promises were received for the whole of the "glacier" coloured windows for the Church. Two were memorials - one given by Mrs. Von Berg, the other by Mrs. Campbell, a third was the gift of Mr. Charles Stevens, another of Dr. Taylor and Mr. R. Wyatt-Smith, and two of Mr. Charles Newberry. "They will be provided in new steel frames with suitable ventilators, instead of the old wooden ones, and will have fends or guards to prevent breakage from outside. The choice of subjects, owing to the size and nearness of the windows, was very limited. Two are of the Annunciation, one of the Resurrection, one of the Ascension, and two of Angels with harps and trumpets. The windows themselves cost about ten pounds each."
</p>
<p>
These windows were a "sandwich" of glass with the paper design between, and according to various reports, the paper designs had to be replaced from time to time.
</p>
<p>
During the general re-arrangement of the church carried out by the Reverend Dennis Stewart, he remarked that the condition of the windows left much to be desired. It was agreed that the glass should be replaced with plain glass and Mr. Bowie investigated the most suitable screens to subdue the light.
</p>
<p>
The minutes record that; "Miss Helen Tennent was trying to find suitable paint for using on glass and would execute symbolic designs as soon as she was able." Miss Tennent exhibited her designs on the notice board for all the congregation to see and, although Mr. Bowie was not too happy with the idea of the windows being painted as he "felt it was unworthy", the windows were duly painted with the symbolic designs and the Rector expressed his delight with the work done by Miss Tennent.
</p>
<p>
In 1972 Miss Tennent, now Mrs. John Dickson, offered to re-do the church windows. The paint that was have been used proved to be unsatisfactory, and Mrs. Dickson proposed an alternative method. She drew up designs for the windows but on submission to the Bishop they were thought to be too intricate. However, at the Vestry Meeting in March 1975 it was reported that plans had been approved and the Parish Church Council was asked to apply for a faculty.
</p>
<p>
The unique and unusual windows have since then become a tourist attraction for visitors to Ficksburg. Each window was first designed on paper. Window glass was then cut to the shape of the window and placed over the design. Glass of all colours was collected from all sources, including bottics, dishes and tumblers, as well as some imported glass, so that various colours and shades would be available. Placing larger pieces of glass between layers of newspaper and in canvas, these were broken to give smaller picces to select for the detail which then began to take form.
</p>
<p>
These pieces were then glucd into place on the window glass, following the design undermeath. In many cases glass picce was layered upon glass picce, giving a three-dimensional appearance to the final picture, as well as building up to the required shade.
</p>
<p>
The work took a year to complete, various parishioncrs donating the money for the materials so that each window, ten in all, is dedicated to a family or member of the congregation.
</p>
<p>
As the sun moves during the day, so the Agapanthus, Protea, Lobelias, Erythrina and other flowers come ablaze to the viewer inside the church, for these were the subject of the windows, not scriptural scencs, but the beauty of the flowers found in the Ficksburg area. No wonder the horticultural societies from all over South Africa include a visit to All Saints' Church in their itinerary of the area.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately that same sunshine which highlights the beauty of the windows causes the glue to deteriorate and pieces of the coloured glass arc already becoming loose and inevitably some picces are swept up by the cleaners. In addition one of the windows was cracked as early as 1977, and it was decided to wire it closed.
</p>

<h1>THE MIDDLE YEARS</h1>

<p>
Canon Orford came as Rector to Ficksburg at the beginning of 1911, but in 1919 as aresult of medical advice he decided to go to the coast. This meant that until the beginning of 1921 the parish was without a Rector, and services were taken by the Reverend Coster, the Rector of Ladybrand. The new Rector was the Reverend S.R. Griggs.
</p>
<p>
An interesting Minute in the Pansh records in 1921 refers to the "Russian Famine Relief Fund". The "Bolshevik Revolution" was still in progress in some parts of the area which became known as the U.S.S.R., and famine struck almost the whole country. Hunger, typhus, and other discases swept the Ukraine and the famine of 1921 struck Kazakhstan, as well as the Volga region, with particular severity. In South Africa grain destined for the famine relief fund was donated by local farmers and stored free of charge by Messrs. Leonard and Johnson. The grain was carried free by the South African Railways. Donations were also requested in cash or kind.
</p>
<p>
The Vestry meeting in 1922 was held "in the cottage opposite the Rectory at 5.15 p.m. following a 'quict afternoon's reflection' in the church, which was conducted by the Bishop." Atthis meeting the Warden, Mr. Whitncy, referred to the effort being made by the Diocesc to obtain funds to purchase a motor car for the usc of the Bishop, and it was decided that the ladics of the congregation would take up the matter "with a vicw to sccing that this Parish borc its share of the necessary expenditure." A bazaar held later in the year realised £58.14.11, of which £25 was donatcd to the Bishop's car fund.
</p>
<p>
Arising out of this, it was proposed at the 1923 Vestry Meeting that the parish should purchase a motor car for the use of the Rector. This was shelved until the following year when the Rector explained the advantage that the vchicle would be to the parish, citing as an example services he had taken at Hammonia. By June of 1924 a motorcar had been purchased and was fully paid for. This was a second-hand Oldsmobile which had been bought for £150. This cnabled the Rector to take services at the farm of Mr. and Mrs. Wandc of Hammonia, and (to start visiting the members in the district including Fouriesburg. A large portion of the needed amount was obtained through a stock sale carried through by Messrs. Joughin and Herne.
</p>
<p>
In the March 1924 edition of the Bloemfontein Diocesan Magazine, the Parish was bewailing the gradual diminishing of the congregation, with a loss of eight communicants in a few months. Later this same year the Reverend Griggs also left the Parish.
</p>
<p>
The 1926 Easter Vestry meeting discussed the question of a new incumbent and it was proposed that the Reverend Harcourt Veron be invited, with the comments already noted in Chapter Five. In fact, one parishioner felt that there was no need for a resident parson at all. As the Bishop had no other person to offer the parish, the Reverend Harcourt Vermmon duly moved to Ficksburg. Thereafter the motorcar was sold.
</p>
<p>
During the years of Canon Harcourt Vernon's Rectorship in Ficksburg the parish went through the usual ups and downs of financial difficulty especially with regard to the payment of the Diocesan Assessment, but, thanks to the efforts of the congregation in gencral and the Women's Guild and Mrs. Vernon's Work Party in particular, they managed to win through.
</p>
<p>
As we have noted, Canon Veron died in December 1936, and the parish was without a Rector until the Reverend and Mrs. Findley arrived from Britain in October 1937, when the Parish welcomed them with a public reception.
</p>
<p>
In 1938 the Diocesan Magazine recorded that Mr. Bok had undertaken the dutics of choirmaster at All Saints', but the Vestry minutes of March 1939 recorded that he had left Ficksburg. The minutes indicate that the choir continued, but no reference was made in the minutes about a choirmaster.
</p>
<p>
A very successful Nativity Play was recorded early in 1938. There was some difficulty in fixing a date for the play performed by the children, and it finally took place on Sunday evening February 6th, in place of Evensong. Even then there was some talk of postponing the play duc to very stormy weather, but it was finally decided to stage the play in spite of the weather. The Church was crowded and cxtra Chairs were needed, with many people of other denominations attending.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Findlcy involved himself with the youth of Ficksburg, very enthusiastically forming a Youth Movement and being instrumental in the revival of the Boy Scouts, the Cubs, and the Girl Guides. At the samc time he endeavourcd to increase the number of serviccs held at Fouriesburg, while maintaining the number of services at Clocolan and Ficksburg.
</p>
<p>
This immediately raised the question of a motorcar again, and the Clocolan Chapelry Iced the way towards raising funds for Us purpose.
</p>
<p>
The first meeting of the Parochial Church Council for the Parish of All Saints', Ficksburg, was held at the Rectory on November 15, 1938, it being decided at the meeting to meet every two months.
</p>
<p>
Mention has been made of the memorial to Father Harcourt Vernon in the form of the Altar and Riddle Posts. In typical parochial fashion it took a number of "Extraordinary" Meetings and a letter from the Bishop, before the parish could decide on the material and colour for the curtains. However, this "vexed" matter seems to have been amicably scttled in time for the Dedication by the Bishop on September 17, 1939. The interior of the Church was also renovated, this being paid for by the Ladies Guild.
</p>
<p>
The Free Will Offering or Envelope Scheme, was started in 1940 on a trial basis and it was unanimously decided in 1941 that it should be continued. The finances had improved to the extent that the Ladies Guild no longer had to assist the Parish with money for the annual Assessment to the Diocese, and they proposed starting a Rectory Fund.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend and Mrs. Findley left Ficksburg in January, 1946 and a farewell social was held for them in the Town Hall. The Reverend Wheat arrived in February of the same year.
</p>
<p>
Due to the difficulty of obtaining new cars in 1946 it was decided to replace the engine of the existing parish car. The old engine was sold and the new engine installed with the Clocolan and Ficksburg congregations sharing the net cost.
</p>
<p>
Although noprevious mention is made of the stables in the corner of the Rectory grounds in any early records, the Church Council minutes of June 7, 1946, raise the matter of the disposal of the materials of the old stables. Apparently at one stage it was proposed that these materials be used for building a mission church at Gumtree, but these plans fell through and the materials were sold out of hand for £5 to Mr. A.M. Macaskill.
</p>
<p>
In 1946 it was also decided that the Acacia trees in the church grounds were becoming a nuisance and they were therefore uprooted in late April.
</p>
<p>
In 1947 the Rector, the Reverend Wheat, proposed that the furniture in the church be rearranged to allow the choir to sit in the Chancel and the organ to be immediately below the Rector's seat. The object of the plan was to allow a better view of the Altar from the nave, as well as make more seating available for the congregation. This plan was approved by the Vestry meeting held in May of that year.
</p>
<p>
By 1950 the old car needed replacing and after first considering the purchase of a Chevrolet it was decided to buy an Opcl. It was considered necessary to buy a larger car rather than economisce on a smaller one as the larger car would "give better service  under hard conditions, greater availability of sparc parts, and the prospect of a better trade-in price in the future".
</p>
<p>
An innovation which took place dunng 1949 - 1950, was the introduction of a "Monday School" on Monday afternoons at 4.30 p.m. for those children who always missed Sunday School due to being out of town on the week-ends. The Sunday School still continued. At this stage Mrs. Louw was taking both Sunday and Monday School but when she left in March, 1952, Mrs. H. Tennent stepped into the breach and took over the Sunday School and also helped Mrs. Chatfield with the Monday School.

<p>
The 60th Anniversary of the building of All Saints' Church was celebrated in 1951, commencing on All Saints' Day, November 1, with the celebration of Holy Communion by the Rector, the Rev. B.G. Chatfield. Then Evensong was celebrated at which the preacher was Canon F. Findley, Rector from 1937 to 1946. The celebrations continued on the Sunday when Bishop C. W. Aldersoncelebrated Holy Communion and Confirmation. An informal social held in the Jewish Communal Hall on the Monday evening finalised the celebrations. At this gathering the Ficksburg News of November 10, 1951, recorded the attendance of, apart from the Anglican clergy, " the Rev. P. Victor, minister of the Ficksburg Methodist Church, and Mrs. Victor; The Rev. D.J. McDonald, Minister of the Ficksburg Dutch Reformed Church, and Mrs. McDonald; the Rev. Father C. Neu of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, and the Rev. I. Mitavsky, Minister of the Ficksburg Hebrew congregation, and Mrs. Mitavsky."
</p>
<p>
Musical items and songs were given, the pianoforte soloist was Miss Cedar Sorour and the vocalists were Mrs. P.H. Tarr and Mrs. W.du Plessis, who were accompanied by Mrs. E. Taylor.
</p>
<p>
In November 1954, the Parish Council Minutes record that one of the council members enquired about items on the agenda at the forthcoming Synod. Two of these items were discussed; 1. That inter-racial services be compulsory, and, 2. That equal stipends be paid to European and African Clergy. The minutes record, "After discussion, the delegates were asked to oppose both motions".
</p>
<p>
The shortage of funds was always a matter for some concern in the Parish and 1958 was no exception. The "Wells" Scheme of fund raising was proposed by Mr. Kohlberg, a Church Warden. The "Wells" Scheme was onc in which a consulting firm undertook (for a fee) to institute   fund raising scheme through a door-to-door "hard-sell" campaign. After consu tation with the Bishop it was decided  hat there were too few parishioners in the district for the Wells Scheme, and in addition the Bishop was not in favour as the scheme was too commercialisced. In spite of this the Church Council
decided to go ahead in October with a Wells canvass although some members opposed the idea. However, before signing the contract with the Wells representatives it was decided not to go ahead with the canvass "in view of certain events here". This note in the Vestry Minutes scems to indicate that those opposing the Wells Scheme had won the day.
</p>
<p>
A Special Vestry meeting was called in August 1958, when it was explained that atleast 1000 pounds per annum was required to meet running expenses, and in 1958 the income had amounted to only 761 pounds. At the meeting slips of paper were distributed on which parishioners were asked to write their names and the amount they would contribute annually.
</p>
<p>
This latter scheme, with the Free Will Offering envelopes in use, seems to have resulted in a better response to fund raising for the next year, although there are indications that assistance from the Ladies Guild was a large contributing factor. Thereafter there was again a steadily increasing deficit reported at each Annual Vestry meeting.In 1961 and 1962 Parish visitation by the council members was organised, and this seemed to have a positive effect on finances. Outstanding debt from Marquard seemed to be a perpetual complaint. The Marquard church seldom paid their dues to the parish, and although with much pressure they had been persuaded to pay in 1962, this matter continued to crop up.
</p>
<p>
In 1962 the new experimental liturgy was tried. In addition, the Rev. D.F. Stewart organised the rearrangement of the Sanctuary. The pews in the nave were moved back to make room for the moving of the altar rails.
</p>
<p>
At Christmas in 1962 a midnight celebration was held using the experimental liturgy. There was also a 7 a.m. service on Christmas morning using the old form of service.
</p>
<p>
The Provincial magazine "Seek" was published for the first ime in 1962, the council minutes recording that it was originally called "See". This magazine came to an end in 1990/91 through lack of support.
</p>
<p>
Experimental liturgies continued to crop up in the years 1969 to 1971, leading up to the more permanent "Liturgy 1975" which continued to be used until the Anglican Prayer Book of 1989 was introduced. There was quite a lot of opposition to the experimental liturgies throughout South Africa, but the Parish of All Saints' seemed to settle down to "Liturgy 1975" quite well in the end.
</p>
<p>
For many centurics the altars in the Anglican churches were placcd against the cast wall, so that the priest stood with his back to the people during the prayer of consecration, "leading the pcoplc to God", as it were. As arcsult of rescarch carried out by all the church denominations in what is known as the "Liturgical Movement", it was felt that the altar should be brought away from the East wall so that the priest, and his assistants in the larger churches, could be facing the people. This would revert to very much the way things were in the early church. During the introduction of the experimental liturgics in the 1960's, many churches in South Africa brought their altars forward. This was evidently done by the Reverend Stewart in 1962. During the incumbency (the incumbent is the rector or minister who has responsibility for a parish) of a rector with more conservative views, the altar at All Saints' "bounced back" to the East wall. The passing of the "Peace" also received the opposition which was current throughout South Africa at this time. Discussion concerning the ordination of women showed surprisingly few objections from the Parish Council although the Rector himself was not in favour.
</p>
<p>
In 1971 the Ladies' Guild offered to have the Harmonium overhauled and so it was transported to Bloemfontein where, in addition to the overhaul, it was fitted with an electric motor and blower. This meant that the organist no longer had to pedal the instrument as well as play it.
</p>
<p>
The lower entrance gates were seriously in need of repair by 1972 and so the Churchwarden, Mr. W. Herne, suggested they be moved to replace the big farm gate.
</p>
<p>
Over the years Bible Studies and discussion groups started but after a while seemed to fade out, as for example the discussion group which met in the early 1970's. The rector of the Parish in 1972, the Reverend Canon Alex Shepperson, commented on this in his report at the Annual Vestry Meeting of that year. "...this is very sad as we need to discuss the relation between our faith and its practice in the everyday world." Various rectors commented in their Vestry reports on the "lack of spirituality" in the parish, and one, in his farewell address, pointedly expressed his joy at going to a parish in the Transvaal where he hoped the congregation would have a better spiritual response.
</p>
<p>
Although all the various churches in the area were, at one time or another responsible to, or part of, the Modderpoort Parish, they had become somewhat autonomous by 1970. Each paid their Diocesan Assessment directly to the Diocesan office even though served by the same rector. This was contrary to the Canons of the Church and so in 1973 an effort was made to rectify this situation. The Councillors of the various churches in Ficksburg, Clocolan, Fouriesburg and Marquard were asked to have a Closer liaison as a possible first step. A meeting of the various Wardens was arranged in Ficksburg in August, 1973. The first meeting of the combined chapclries took place on April 23, 1978 under the chairmanship of the Rector, the Reverend Ted Schurr.
</p>
<p>
The first of the Deanery Council meetings was organised in November 1974 with membership consisting of the clergy and two representatives from each pastoral charge. This meeting was held in Ficksburg and attended by the Wardens.
</p>
<p>
Church Unity had been a subject of much discussion for many years. The Lambeth Conferences had had it on their agenda in the 1940's, and in 1974 the Church Unity Commission was established with the Anglican Church as a founder member. It was therefore inevitable that efforts towards church unity should percolate down to the parish level. During the early 1970's the resident Methodist minister of the day felt that Ficksburg was not ready for it, so efforts in this direction came to nothing until in December 1974, when a joint Communion service was held in the All Saints' Church. It was acclaimed a great success.
</p>
<p>
Canon Shepperson was only temporarily resident in Ficksburg and, after he left, the parish was pleased to have Bishop Claxton of Blackbum, the sister Diocese in England, stay over in Ficksburg during the interregnum.
</p>
<p>
In September 1975 the choir from St. Andrew's School in Bloemfontein paid a visit to Ficksburg and in March 1977 the Reverend Don Martin was invited to conduct a Mission in Ficksburg. This was followed with a visit by St. Michael's School Choir in March 1978 and Father Ruston conducted the service. Father Ruston was the chaplain at St. Michael's school in Bloemfontein and, after moving to the Pretoria Diocese where he was a suffragan Bishop, has recently been elected Bishop of St. Helena.
</p>
<p>
Heating, the all-important requirement for the "comfortable pew', was decided upon in 1977. The Guild was again the main financial support for this venture, paying R500 towards the costs while the Parish paid the balance of R300, enabling the installation to be completed by the end of June. In addition the Aumbry for the reserved Sacrament was installed in the wall of the church.
</p>
<p>
About this time, 1978, the story of the Anglican Church's support of the World Council of Churches' "Terrorist activities", together with other excuses for non-payment of contributions became a contentious issue. In spite of repeated denials that the Church of the Province was funding all sorts of illegal activities, the excuse was still heard well into 1989.
</p>
<p>
Naturally the whole "church must keep out of politics" debate was hotting up at this time throughout the country, and the Parish Council of All Saints' Church was no exception. In the rapidly changing political and social atmosphere of the 1990's the comments of various members as recorded in 1978 are surprisingly understanding for the times, although the rigid ideas of socicty, as it was then, show through.
</p>
<p>
During 1979 controversy arose in the Parish Church Council in Ficksburg over an entirely domestic matter. This resulted in the temporary resignation of the Chairman, the Reverend Ted Schurr. After some months and a visit from the Bishop some degree of reconciliation in the Council enabled meetings to continuc. A radical change in the Parish Council took place at the next Vestry Meeting with only one member of the previous Council being elected onto the new Council.
</p>
<p>
The early 1980's saw further efforts to amalgamate the chapelries into a Parish with chapelries, and so bring them into line with the Canons of the Church. Vestry meetings were held to discuss this development, and agreement was reached about carrying it through. These efforts also meant a bit of a re-shuffle to bring Clocolan into the Deanery of BethIchem, as up to this date ithad been part of the Modderpoort Region.
</p>
<p>
For a while, combined Parish Council meetings were held in addition to Chapelry Council Meetings in all four areas, but by 1983 it was realised that a tremendous amount of duplication was taking place, and the decision was taken to hold only Parish Council Meetings, with representatives from all the "chapelries".
</p>
<p>
The first record of a proposed "Garden of Remembrance" for All Saints' was made at the June 1974 Parish Council Meeting in Ficksburg. At this stage there was apparently a possibility that a book made of granite would be donated to the parish for installing in the "Garden". The idea was for an area to be walled off with a gate to protect the garden "from animals and small children". There would be a lawn with the granite book placed in the centre and a pathway would go around the lawn. A map would be maintained to show the position of the ashes. Mrs. Barbara von Maltitz drew up the initial outline plan for the Garden.
</p>
<p>
An estimate of the costs of the Garden was made by Mr. Bowie in mid- 1975.
</p>
<p>
This amounted to R600 for material and R400 for labour. About 10% of this had already been donated. The granite book was at this stage also still available as a donation from a monumental mason in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>
By May 1976 the Rector, the Reverend Daile Pillans, reported that cut stone suitable for the garden was available free of charge from Mr. Steyn, and could be transported by Mr. John Moffett. However in August of the same year it was decided that "the matter should be deferred until further information was received and until the need arose."
</p>
<p>
In March of the following year the Council had to finalise the plans as the Vestry Meeting held in February had instructed that the project should proceed. This led to numerous discussions regarding the type of wall to be built.
</p>
<p>
In this way nothing more positive was done until the Vestry Meeting in 1978 when the subject was again raised. By June R1000 was available for the Garden but members of the Council were sll maintaining that they did not have aclear concept of what was required. In August it was thought that a brick and stone wall would be too expensive and a stone wall would be acceptable.
</p>
<p>
By September a bird-bath as a feature had been offered by Mrs. Alice Tennent and stone offered by Mr. Peter Bowic, soit looked as though things were finally moving.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly enough, a faculty for the Garden had been applied for and received. Surprising, because so often All Saints' Church seems to have done all sorts of things without official approval, much to the Bishop's surprise in each instance when he found out.
</p>
<p>
The minutes of the Church Council Meeting heldon February 1, 1979, reported that the wall was almost complete, but that work on the grounds had been halted until a very Clear picture was presented as to the placing of the ashes and the plaques. Mrs. Helen Dickson now offered to submit a drawing giving her ideas. The faculty had been approved on the original plan submitted, but some difficulty was now experienced in finding a copy of that original plan. As Mrs. Helen Dickson still wanted to work on the wall feature "but had other commitments," the work was again shelved.
</p>
<p>
In 1980, Mrs. Barbara von Maltitz agreed to see what could be done to make the existing wall more attractive. So the council decided to await her advice, and in July decided that the congregation should be asked for their ideas. About this time the Rector left Ficksburg and so everything was left until the arrival of the new Rector.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Ivor Atherstone arrived in 1981 and managed to find the old plans and Mrs. Helen Dickson, together with her mother Mrs. Alice Tennent, agreed to complete the Garden. S1x sandstone benches were donated to the church. Delays were encountered due to the difficulty in obtaining suitable labour to cut stone and so the Garden was not completed until the beginning of 1984, although cutting the headstones to the required shape still presented a problem.
</p>
<p>
This was not the end of the drama concerning the Garden of Remembrance as during 1984 the Rector moved the bird-bath without consulting anyone, and this caused considerable controversy among certain members of the Parish.
</p>
<p>
The first ashes were buried in the Garden of Remembrance in 1987.

<h1>THEN --- AND NOW</h1>

<p>
During 1983 the state of the hall was discussed in Parish Council Meetings and by the Ladies Guild, and proposals were made to build a new one. After prolonged investigation the hall matter was dropped.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Cecil Rogerson started his first full year in the parish by arranging for the Reverend Peter Gunning to conduct an all-day Seminar for the Church Council with regard to their function. The Reverend Frank Nelson of Harrismith conducted a healing service on September 16, 1984, and the Reverend Ken Crosbie and his team from Turffontein ran a weekend mission in April 1985.
</p>
<p>
A Mission Week in the parish was also run by a team from St. Paul's College, Grahamstown, and led by The Reverend Chich Hewitt. This took place in August/ September 1985. Each chapelry determined its own needs and this information was fed to the Mission team. The following themes were therefor decided upon.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In Ficksburg:
<ul>
<li>Basic teaching on the Christian Faith</li>
<li>Your place in the church</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In Fouriesburg:
<ul>
<li>Salvation</li>
<li>Doctrinal Issues - Basic teaching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In Marquard:

<ul>
<li>Basics of the Christian Faith</li>
<li>The modem - traditional approach to the church</li>
<li>Applications to our daily lives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>


In Clocolan:
<ul>
<li>Applications to our daily lives</li>
<li>Basic Teaching on the Christian Faith</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
During his stay in Ficksburg the Reverend Cecil Rogerson married Joca Arcas, whom he had met in Ficksburg.
In 1985 the Partners-in-Mission programme was launched in the Province of South Africa and the Rector of All Saints' Parish organised various discussions on the subject.
</p>
<p>
For any number of years services had been held at the church at Prynnesberg. These were mainly held when there was a fifth Sunday in a month and attended by people from Clocolan and Gumtree. After the service Mrs. Newberry served tea up at the house.
</p>
<p>
Attendance declined over the years and finally Mrs. Daphne Newberry could no longer attend services and the congregation consisted mainly of parishioners from Clocolan who normally attended services at St. George's Church. Father Cecil Rogerson therefore suggested that these services be discontinued and, with the concurrence of the Parish Council, a Parish Service at All Saints' was arranged for the Sth Sunday services instead of that at Prynnesberg.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Rogerson left the parish in April 1986 to take up a post at the chapelry of St. Michael and All Angels in Weltevreden Park, Florida, in the Diocese of Johannesburg. He was followed at All Saints' by the Reverend Andrew Colley who came to the parish from Secunda, in the Diocese of Johannesburg.
</p>
<p>
Finances continued to be a burden to the parish, with a debt of about R6000 owing to the Diocese. In addition, the "Parish Car" was a Light Delivery Truck and there were no funds for a car replacement. Over the next few years a concerted effort was made torcctify this situation. The "bakkie" was sold and an older car bought, as an initial step. After about a year, thanks to some generous donations towards a "car fund" a slightly newer, although still second-hand car was bought. By 1991 this movement had resulted in the parish owning a 1988 Toyota Cressida, fully paid for and with some money in the car replacement fund.
</p>
<p>
The name of Sorour has occurred before although not in any major way. This obscures the way members of the family have quictly worked in the background and on Parish Council to the great advantage of the Parish Church. One such was Mr. S. Sorour, fondly known as Oom Japie, who was very active on the Parish Council especially at the time the move was made to build a new church. Bom in the Lebanon, Oom Japic emigrated to South Africa in 1912 and together with his brothers, settled in Ficksburg where they became members of the little Anglican Church of All Saints'. In the late 1980's the Rector was anxious to ensure the safe keeping of all the Parish records, and a large document safe was obtained through financial assistance which was raised by Oom Japie.
</p>
<p>
Father Colley was given the task of being Rector of two other parishes in addition to that of All Saints'. These were, St. Paul's, Meqhcleng, Ficksburg, and St. James', Ladybrand.
</p>
<p>
The effect at All Saints' was that Father Colley was out of Ficksburg very often, and had to race around taking various services around the three parishes, but it had the advantage that the Diocese was persuaded to lower the Common Fund Assessment for the parish during this period, which gave the parish an opportunity to re-establish itself financially.
</p>

<div class="figure landscape">
    <img alt="A visit from Kindi School" src="images/image017.jpg" class="photo"/> 
 
    <div class="figcaption">A visit from Kindi School</div>
</div>

<p>
This Rectorship he held in plurality for about two years until he received an assistant, the Reverend Jeremiah Ramantsi, who eventually took over as priest-in-charge at St. Paul's. Father Colley was then also relieved of Ladybrand by the Reverend Chris Lubbe.
</p>
<p>
Bible Study groups were established in 1986 in Clocolan, Ficksburg and Gumtrec, with a once-a-month meeting in Fouriesburg. These continued until about 1990 but for various reasons were discontinued in Fouriesburg and Gumtree. Groups still continued to meet in Ficksburg and Clocolan. This latter Group, although quite small at times, were very faithful in their attendance.
</p>
<p>
Shortly before Easter in 1987 a Passover Supper was organised for the Parish Councillors and their spouses. Other guests were the Methodist Minister, the Reverend Paul Viljoen, and his wife Hilary. Confirmation candidates of that year also attended. As a worshipful teaching occasion and a tme of fellowship it was enjoyed by all who attended. Other Passover suppers were arranged at Gumtree and Clocolan.
</p>
<p>
A highlight of 1987 was a luncheon held after the All Saints' Day service at which the Venerable John Davis was the celebrant.
</p>
<p>
The Right Reverend "Bill" Burnett, the retired Archbishop who had also at one time been Bishop of Bloemfontein, was asked to come to Ficksburg in 1989, and arrangements were made for him to lead a series of talks on "Christian Growth". Sister Joan, from St. Michael and All Angels, Bloemfontein, joined him and All Saints' Church joined with the Methodist Church in the series of meetings which drew a goodly number of people.
</p>
<p>
The following month, Bishop Ruston, who was in the arca for a wedding, took the Eucharist Service at All Saints'. As mentioned before, he was well-known to many in Ficksburg, having been school chaplain at St. Michael's School in Bloemfontein.
</p>
<p>
The new Anglican Prayer Book of 1989 was introduced very successfully throughout the Parish, with most of the books being donated by individuals. Some hesitancy was experienced with the slight alteration or omittance of words in well-known passages, such as the omittance of the word "men", in the passage "for us men and our salvation", which had implied all mankind but was now seen as using "sexist" language. However, the changeover went quite smoothly in spite of these hiccups.
</p>
<p>
In August of 1990 a Special Vestry meeting was called to form a subcommittee to plan and co-ordinate the All Saints' centenary celebrations which were due to take place in 1991.
</p>
<p>
It was decided that these celebrations should consist of not only one special occasion on a particular day, but for activities to be planned for a whole year. It was also decided that some events should take place in Clocolan and Fouriesburg.
</p>
<p>
The Centenary year therefore started off in the parish with a celebration commemorating All Saints' Day, and held on November 4, 1990, when the Dean of Bloemfontein Cathedral, the Very Reverend Paddy Glover was the guest preacher. Following the service a luncheon under the trees in the Church gardens was arranged by the Ladies Guild. Visitors included people from Slabberts, Marseilles, Ladybrand, Bloemfontein and Leribe, as well as friends from other denominations.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday 1 1th the congregation of St. Mary's, Fouriesburg, were hosted to a "Bring and Share Braai" by Denton and Margie Osler at their farm *Ettrick'. This followed the 10 o'clock service at St. Mary's church.
</p>
<p>
The 14th of December was the date of a thanksgiving service for the All Saints' Ladies Guild. It was followed by their annual party in the hall.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday 16 December there was a Service of Carols and Nine lessons held in the church gardens at which Mrs. Petro Wille of the Methodist Church started the singing with the traditional solo first verse of "Once in Royal David's City". The Rector, Mr. Basil Rudman, and Mr. Michael van Gelder sang the solo verses of "We Three Kings".
</p>
<p>
Christmas Services took the order that had been prevalent for the last few years, namely, St. George's at 7.00.a.m., All Saints' at 8.30 a.m., and St. Mary's at 11.00 a.m., although it was decided to start the service at St. Mary's at 10.30 in future.
</p>
<p>
Father Raymond Brown from Leribe, an old friend of All Saints' Parish, took the service in Ficksburg on the 6th of January, 1991. Ithad been planned that clergy who had served All Saints' Parish in the past would be invited to visit during the year as part of the celebrations, but this did not quite work out. However, the church in Leribe having been closely associated with All Saints' in the past, and having often supplicd a priest when needed, it was felt that a visit from a priest from Leribe was essentual in this year of celebrations, and Father Brown was the ideal representative.
</p>
<p>
During the year Miss Jane Duffy, who had served as amissionary in Swaziland and a teacher in Leribe, stayed in the hall at All Saints (with her two cats), and served as a parish worker for about six months, doing excellent work as Sunday School teacher, leader of a Bible Study Group, organist for St. George's, and Church Visitor, as well as typing for the Rector. She eventually returned to Britain in September.
</p>
<p>
The Annual Vestry meetings were held early in the year, with the parishioners of both St. George's and All Saints' meeting after their respecuve services on 3rd February. St. Mary's parishioners followed with their Vestry Meeting on the 10th March after their 10 o'clock service.
</p>
<p>
Shrove Tuesday was celebrated in grand style on 1 2th February with pancakes galore. Mr. Michael van Gelder, a church warden, joined in the pancake making and was voted by at least one young parishioner as "the Champ".
</p>
<p>
For about a year, All Saints' Church had been trying to obtain a pipe organ to replace the Harmonium which was showing its age in no uncertain manner. After much effort, without any success in the price range the Church felt it could afford, a demonstration of an Alan Digital organ was arranged for Sunday 24 February, during the 10 o'clock service. This created such an impression that the decision was taken to buy the organ. A licence of faculty had already been obtained from the bishop for a new organ and so the organ stayed where it was after the demonstration service. We have noted in Chapter Three how generous donations from the Ladies Guild and various parishioners paid for the organ.
</p>
<p>
The "Women's World Day of Prayer" service was held on the Ist March and this year the Methodists and Anglicans combined to have the service at All Saints' Church so that it could be part of the centenary celebrations.
</p>
<p>
The Reverend Tony Dalton from the Diocese of Blackbur, England, was the visiting priest on Sunday March 3, although there was a rather disappointing congregation as regards numbers.
</p>
<p>
Holy Week services were included in the parish calender and a highlight here was the reading of the Lord's Passion from St. John's Gospel with various parishioners taking individual parts. This was organised by Mrs. Erica Stevens.
</p>
<p>
The Easter Sunday Services took the same order as the Christmas Services, with large congregations at all the churches even though many parishioners were away over the Easter period.
</p>
<p>
The first Sunday in April, thatis, April 7, was the occasion of a visit from the Vencrable Kiewiet Rasmeni, again an old friend of All Saints. Father Kiewiet both Celebrated and preached. A renewal of marriage vows service was held at St. George's Church on the 21st April. Father Kiewiet as visiting preacher was followed in May by the Very Reverend Godfrey Henwood, Dean of the Johannesburg Cathedral, who preached at the 10 o'clock service at All Saints'.
</p>
<p>
On Ascension Day a Eucharist service was held at the farm "Faust" and followed by a parish picnic out near the cave on the farm. This event on Ascension Day was tried in 1990 with great enjoyment by those who attended and sorepeated this year.
</p>
<p>
The next priest to visit was the Venerable David Bannerman from Welkom, who preached at the Eucharist on the 2nd of June. Tea was always served by the Ladies Guild after the service on these first Sunday's when there was a guest preacher.
</p>
<p>
Father Tom Cripps, who had served in the parish after his retirement to Fouriesburg, now came on a visit from England where he was living in areurement home for priests. He preached at the Eucharist service on Sunday July 7.
</p>
<p>
As will have been noted in the previous chapter, Ficksburg had been part of the Archdeaconry of Bethlehem. Because of the rapid growth of Botshabelo and Thaba 'Nchu the Bishop in Chapter decided in 1991 to form a new Archdeaconry of these parishes with Selosesha, Verkeerdevlei and Ramahutsi. This then required the rearrangement of the Archdeaconry of Modderpoort and the result was that Ficksburg and Founesburg now fell into this Archdeaconry and the Rector of Ficksburg was appointed as Archdeacon.
</p>
<p>
It had been intended that a service should be held in February on the site of the old "Grove Church" in the Clocolan District. However the rain caused this service to be cancelled, and it was then held on the 21st of July and was followed by a braai and picnic lunch at "Lovedale", the home of Annemarie and Llewelyn Rudman. The hymns sung at the service were the same ones that had been sung over a hundred years before at the dedication of the Grove Church by the then Bishop of the Diocese.
</p>
<p>
There was an innovation at the service on August 4, 1992, when ladies assisted the Rector in the Eucharist and the preacher was Mrs. Linda Lubbe, wife of the Rector of Ladybrand. This must have been a first for All Saints'.
</p>
<p>
St. Francis Day celebrations were held on the 6th of October with a service in the Garden of Remembrance. The Reverend Cecil Rogerson preached and pets brought to the service by members of the congregation were blessed. Tea at the hall followed as usual and again an occasion which could be repeated was enjoyed by all.
</p>
<p>
Saturday November 2nd saw the occasion of the Grand Dinner at the New Ficksburg hotel. Parishioners and friends turned out in force to this momentous occasion at which the Bishop, the Right Reverend Thomas Stanagc, The Mayor of Ficksburg and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Xavier du Toit and a number of others, including ministers from other denominations, were guests.
</p>
<p>
After a sherry on arrival at the Dinner, everyone was assembicd in the Dining Room by the mastcr-of ceremonics, Mr. Mark von Maltitz. The room had been beautifully prepared by the ladies, and the lovely table decorations arranged by Mrs. Barbara von Maltuitz and members of the family, with the theme "Plants and Flowers of the Bible".
</p>
<p>
As everyone sat down at their tables a cake with 100 candlcs was brought in by the Rector while everyone sang "When all the Saints". The idea was for the candles to be extinguished by the Bishop assisted by the Rector. The cake was to be kept and eaten at the tea to be served after the Rededication Eucharist the next day. However......when the 100 candles were lit the heat generated was such that they quickly burned down, and down, night into the cake, before the cake got to the Bishop. After the dinner, when Miss Cedar Sorour, who had baked the cake, cut the top layer of icing mixed with candle grease off the cake, she found that the candles had burnt right down into the cake and the cake was inedible. However.... back at the Dinner all this was unknown to the diners, and the party continued.

</div>

<p>
Before the Grace was sung the Bishop started with a prayer that "We would not be like porridge, stiff and stodgy and difficult to stir, but rather like Com Flakes, fresh and crisp and ready to serve." This caused the guests, especially the Dominees, to sit up and take notice of these Anglicans, and set the tone for the most enjoyable evening.
</p>
<p>
The Bishop and the Mayor gave short addresses during the dinner, and the Rector gave a short "potted history". Just before the sweets were brought in a presentation was made by the Bishop, on behalf of the Parish, to Andrew Heyns for his service on the Council and 30 years as Chapelry Warden at St. George's; and to Cedar Sorour for her many years of service, particularly as organist at All Saints.
</p>
<p>
Bishop Tom then kept the Hotel staff on tenterhooks as they hovered with the ice-cream while he gave a short, but totally unexpected, exposition of the various versions of the Bible.
</p>
<p>
Finally, after a short organ recital of some favourite songs by the Bishop, and the singing of "Auld Lang Syne", the hotel staff served coffee and peppermint chocolates before everyone reluctantly went home.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday morning a large congregation asscmbled at All Saints' Church for the re-dedication Eucharist conducted by Bishop Tom. This commenced with the Bishop being received at the North door of the church by the wardens and requested by them to bless the building and to offer it once more to God. After a short prayer the Bishop knocked at the door for entrance and was presented with the key to the door.
</p>
<p>
As the Bishop made his way to the chancel the congregation sang the hymn, 'God is here! As we His people meet to offer praise and prayer', sung to the tune 'Austria' (familiarly used for the hymn 'Glorious things of Thee are spoken').
</p>
<p>
The Liturgy of the Word with sermon then took place, followed by the Blessing of the Church, Vestry, Font, Organ and Altar, and then the Communion of all the congregation. The service ended with the singing of the Hymn, 'For all the saints, who from their labours rest'. Among the clergy who were present at the Eucharist were the Reverend Raymend Brown from Leribe, and the Reverend Ed den Blaauwen from Bethlehem.
</p>
<p>
Tea was served after the service and the Rector and his wife entertained a number of visitors and senior parishioners such as Mrs. Alice Tennent, Mrs. Gwen Wille, Mrs. Lois Joughin and Mrs. Sara Peacock, to lunch in the Rectory.
</p>
<p>
The Theme of the Service sheet for the re-dedication service was ttled, "1991 - Into the Future", and it is with this new beginning in the life of All Saints' Parish that we end this book.

<h2>The "Flower" Windows</h2>

<p>
There are ten windowsin All Saints' Church, eight of which are shown in the photographs in this book. The work is a montage of glass and the work took a year to complete, with the artist working almost daily at the task. The cost of the materials for the windows was covered by donations from parishioners, the work lovingly carried out by Mrs. Helen Dickson.
</p>
<p>
The designs, of wild flowers which grew abundantly in Ficksburg before "progress" drove them out, were first exhibited as suggestions for the church windows. It was some time before permission to start the windows could be obtained.
