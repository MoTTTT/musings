- They will grow, and rise, and fill your view

- You will know the fear when you feel it
- You will doubt your courage, strength and power
- You will think, and certainty will falter
- Abundant doubts will spawn and fill your mind

- There are no doors for flight
- There is no sword to Fight
- The only advice I have for me
- Just remember to breathe

- And you will {rise and} greet the Fate that you have Chosen
- And Overcome to repeat it all again

The Communion of Soul

Capitalised words to be Expanded.

- Being Born a piece of the Communion {We} Separates into a {human} Host
- The We {this piece of us} is in Communion with the I and the Me of the Host over it's lifetime
- The congregation of the We, the I and the Me forms an Individual Identity
- Our Host has capacity to Sense
- Our Host has capacity to Focus
- Our Host has capacity to Remember
- The Sense, the Focus, and the Memory Causes the Identity to Experience Time
- The Experience of Time is Characterised by the Host's Capacity to Sense, Focus, and Remember

- Will is an Agreement {negotiation} between the We, the I and the Me
- Will is a Function of Time
- Will is a Function of Focus
- Will Shapes the Identity

- Energy is a Function of the Host, and it's Environment
- Energy is a Function of Time

- The Application of Will by the Identity, combines Time and Energy to Create
- The result of Creation is Emanation

- Focus Imposes Time between the Identity and the Communion, Increasing the Separation of Birth
- The Emanation {Outcome of the Identity's Application of Will} Accrues to the Communion
